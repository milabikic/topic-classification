Given the general absence of sex, drugs and rock’n’roll, bands tend to run away from middle England. But for Rob Knaggs, the songwriter with Sports Team, it’s where the action is. “I really like roundabouts, Britain in Bloom competitions, local parish newsletters,” he says. “High streets are covered in people’s symbols of belonging – like an Emma Bridgewater tin.” His six-piece band are making something improbably big out of this minutiae. Formed in 2016 while they were studying at Cambridge, in the past two years their exuberant indie-pop has taken them from tiny pub stages to a major label deal and, the day I meet them, filling the 2,300-capacity Forum in Kentish Town, north London. Their debut album comes out this spring. Along the way they have cultivated a young fanbase given to making memes and congregating on a WhatsApp group with the band. “Sometimes you’ll open your phone and there’ll be 2,000 messages, and they’re all bickering for 45 minutes about vegetable crisps,” Knaggs says. These are the middle-class kids who might have turned to rap, but now have, in Sports Team, a band singing about their lives. “We had this experience of life being quite mundane,” says the frontman, Alex Rice, whose bandmates grew up in Cheshire, Kent and Leeds. “If you’re a kid from Tunbridge Wells and you’re going to Pitcher and Piano on a Thursday, where’s the music for you? You want something that romanticises the world around you and makes you feel better about it.” Knaggs’ heroes are John Betjeman, Kurt Vonnegut and Richard Brautigan; his songs, about fishing, Wetherspoons, flip phones and the M5, similarly find uplifting poetry in the everyday. One of their first songs, Stanton, was about the fire warden at their Cambridge college. “He would stand on this barrow, and say: ‘I’ve seen people burn to death!’” Knaggs says. “He took his job seriously, but it was intense.” Musically, the band bonded over bands such as Pavement. “Guitar music was not very cool,” Rice says. So to make their shows seem like “anything but a guitar music gig”, they invented Poundband, a club night with £1 entry that would feature sideshows such as their keyboardist, Ben Mack, doing, by his own admission, “freestyle rapping over eskibeats”. These japes evaporated when they graduated and moved in together in London, doing jobs in everything from social care to social media. “There was a sense of frustration at the social contract: you graduate, you get this job, and you’re supposed to feel fulfilled and happy,” says the drummer, Al Greenwood. “It very quickly became so routine. We were so lucky – it’s amazing to have a job and live independently in London. But there was a sense that there must be something more. A lot of friends are very successful, but very few of them say they are happy.” Rice agrees: “We really enjoyed Cambridge, going to lectures, thinking about things. It was quite stark for me that, when you come out, you’re really required to stop thinking to an enormous extent.” He says that a big part of the band is “to provide people with an alternative way to live their lives – we try to make it look joyful”. They are an endearing group, frequently bursting into laughter around the pub table, and weren’t always enamoured of their moodier London peers. “Having just moved to London you’d think everyone that was involved in music was a Goldsmiths graduate – some kind of Gucci magician,” Rice says, meaning the hyped glam troupe HMLTD, who Rice describes as “one of the worst bands ever”. It’s rather refreshing to have them indulge in the kind of sniping that once powered petty intra-scene dramas in the NME – Shame have been another target of their light-hearted beef. “[Indie magazines] DIY and Dork, they have to call every band the greatest band in the world because they rely on social media shares, and we just got a bit sick of it,” Rice says. “Part of having a sense of identity as a band is saying: this is what we’re not.” For Greenwood, what they’re not is “lazy, Martin Parr-esque” imagery; for Knaggs, it’s “posing in leather jackets with cigarettes in moody landscapes, that level of Strokes-yness. They’re like: ‘Oh, we’re poets, we got our lyrics by sitting in a pub and channelling James Joyce.’” Hang on, you’re sitting in a pub saying you’re channelling Betjeman! “At least our lyrics were written on a laptop in the studio, desperately trying to find a word that rhymes with rhododendrons,” Knaggs grins. “It doesn’t have to be a wilted rose to have some great significance – it could be a Motorola. It doesn’t have to be a skull, or a child smoking – it could be Ashton Kutcher. That could be your memento mori, that incredible poetic image. It doesn’t have to be a raven, or a grave, or Dublin in the rain. It could be London in the sunshine. It could be Thorpe Park on a Wednesday.” “Dublin in the rain” is, of course, a lyric by the Joyce-inspired band Fontaines DC, but Knaggs says they all love them, and Rice agrees: “There’ll always be a place for post-punk, but no one’s doing anything that new in it. Fontaines played last week and the average age [in the crowd] must have been mid-40s – brilliant, but it’s not that punk. It’s incredibly wealthy craft-ale fans. You go to our front row, it’s kids, it feels more vital and important.” Rice’s flouncing, peacocking stagecraft is a key part of the band’s vitality. “I hate every minute of being in the studio, I find it painfully dull, but performing is incredible – riling up a crowd for an hour,” he says. “People want something that feels a bit heroic on stage. They do want to feel a part of the gang, but you shouldn’t be too accessible.” “And yet everyone has your number on a WhatsApp group,” says the bassist, Oli Dewdney, after a perfect comic beat. With their Cambridge education and rhododendron-based lyrics, “there’s a risk of throwaway comments: ‘Oh, they’re Tories’”, Greenwood says. One journalist even accused them of a “poverty safari” by visiting Margate. Yet Sports Team’s complicated, sometimes contradictory character portraits are a noble, or perhaps naive attempt to avoid the factionalism of modern society and politics. Rice says “we’re all pretty Labour”, but “not tribal ... that Idles record, just coming out with a ‘fuck Boris’ attitude, it’s the tritest, cheapest form of politics. We’ve got this opportunity to be really subtle and actually engage people, rather than just trotting out talking points.” A union-jack-wearing character in their song The Races appears to be your typical side of Tory gammon – “He’ll never buy you a drink / But he’ll let you know he can” – but Rice says “there’s always an empathetic take. Even Kutcher, about a guy who’s frustrated with his haircut, is quite an empathetic portrayal.” Lots of people won’t have empathy with middle England right now, of course – but it’s just as much a part of Britain as anything and, as Rice says: “It would be far more dangerous if we turned up in flat caps and started doing northern accents, and you’ve seen plenty of bands doing that.” For once, he doesn’t name them.
In condemning the lack of gender balance in films (This year, I’m going on a new cinematic diet, 7 January) Alice O’Keeffe refers to the “measly 4% of female directors on the top 100 grossing films of 2018”. That is indeed depressing, but if you take a broader range of films, including the work of independent film-makers and films from around the world in languages other than English, then the picture is rather more cheering. This is hardly scientific, but of the 56 films I saw in 2019, nearly all of them in Sheffield’s broad-ranging Showroom Cinema, 13 (23%) were directed, or in a couple of cases co-directed, by women and they included more than half of my favourite films of the year, namely Capernaum (Nadine Labaki), Happy as Lazzaro (Alice Rohrwacher), Birds of Passage (Cristina Gallego, with Ciro Guerra), For Sama (Waad Al-Kateab, with Edward Watts), The Farewell (Lulu Wang) and, bringing the year to a happy end, Greta Gerwig’s superb adaptation of Little Women.
About 35 minutes into Peter Weir’s Gallipoli, Archy (Mark Lee) and Frank (Mel Gibson), two champion-level sprinters from Australia, are trudging their way through 50 miles of desert in a desperate effort to make it to Perth and enlist to serve their country in the first world war. Along the way, they encounter a grizzled camel driver who doesn’t even realize there’s a war against Germany. The stranger has questions. “How did it start?” he wonders. “Don’t know exactly,” replies Archy. “But it was the Germans’ fault.” They tell the man they’re headed to the front in Turkey, because the Turks are German allies. “Huh, you learn something new every day,” he says. “Still, I can’t see what it’s got to do with us.” “If we don’t stop them there, they could end up here,” Archy argues. The man looks around this godforsaken stretch of land and deadpans, “And they’re welcome to it.” In a nutshell, this conversation suggests the arc of many first world war movies: naive young men eager to serve their countries and embark on the adventure of a lifetime. Confusion over why, exactly, the war is being fought. And later, the absolute terror of life in the trenches and full-on disillusionment over what they’ve been asked to do and how this unimaginable carnage will make the world a better place. There’s only one real battle scene in Gallipoli, if it can even be called a battle: Archy and Frank have traveled halfway around the world for the privilege of joining the waves of Anzac (Australian and New Zealand Army Corps) cut down by Turkish machine guns a few steps out of the trench. Their lives are lost to the catastrophic miscalculation of their betters. With Sam Mendes’s 1917 currently in theaters, it’s a rare chance to see how it fits into a tradition of first world war movies – which have, naturally, been vastly eclipsed by movies about the war that followed two decades later. To the extent that 1917 is even about the war, it echoes the friendship at the center of Gallipoli and Frank’s fateful dash at the end of it, when he rushes at top speed to keep the officers in charge from sending men on a suicide mission. We don’t learn much about Lance Cpl Schofield (George MacKay) and Lance Cpl Blake (Dean-Charles Chapman), the British soldiers asked to embark on a life-saving quest across enemy lines to keep 1,600 comrades from falling into a German trap. But their individual sacrifice is a silver lining common to many first world war movies: in the absence of a larger and nobler purpose, the best soldiers can do is fight for each other, and hope to spare a life or steal a little bit of dignity and humanity. Though 1917 takes place against the haunted backdrop of abandoned trenches, bombed-out facades and corpse-strewn thickets of barbed wire, the limits of its time-frame (and faux-single-shot continuity) forbid a larger picture of the war. By contrast, the great classics of WWI make a strong argument for the Great War as a foundational moment in anti-war cinema, because they all underscore the pointlessness of the conflict and cast a jaundiced eye toward the mendacity of the men responsible. The standard-bearer for all first world war films is Lewis Milestone’s 1930 masterpiece All Quiet on the Western Front, a best picture winner that’s astonishingly blunt about the grand-scale nihilism of the war, following a group of German boys whose teacher rallies them into enlistment. They’re led to believe it will be a short and glorious adventure, but one of them gets killed before they even reach their post and the rest are picked off over endless days of aerial bombardments, food shortages and machine-gun nests. Unlike many early-sound movies, All Quiet on the Western Front doesn’t bolt itself down to stilted exchanges of dialogue, but spends Universal’s bottomless resources on battle sequences of startling scope. And when there’s finally a break in the carnage and a survivor finds himself back in the classroom on leave, there’s his teacher goading an even younger generation of boys into action. Nothing is gained, nothing is learned. Five years earlier, King Vidor’s silent epic The Big Parade provided a blueprint for the scaled-up action of All Quiet on the Western Front, but it takes its time getting to the front, focusing instead on the relationship between Jim (John Gilbert), an idle American from a wealthy family, his working-class brothers-in-arms and Melisandre (Renée Adorée), the Frenchwoman they meet while training in the Marne. The extra time allows Vidor the opportunity to humanize the characters through slapstick shenanigans and the wordless romance between Jim and Melisandre, who share only the language of love. By the time the action shifts toward a harrowing march through the woods to confront the Germans, the human stakes couldn’t be higher, especially when Jim and his buddies are asked to leave a shellhole at night to quell the mortar fire of a German nest. They realize instantly that not all of them will survive until morning. The ordering of suicide missions is a running theme in first world war movies, which often contrast the bravery of the rank-and-file with leaders who are either tragically wrong-headed or openly reckless in leading these lambs to the slaughter. Stanley Kubrick’s 1957 film Paths of Glory is about a French general who knowingly orders his division to a suicidal attack on a heavily fortified German “anthill”, then arbitrarily court-martials three men for cowardice when the first wave gets cut down and the second refuses to leave the trench. Kubrick presents the show trial that follows as the height of absurdity, mounted entirely as a face-saving measure for a general who’s seeking a promotion at the grunts’ expense. (Nearly half a century later, Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s A Very Long Engagement would pick up on a similar story of soldiers condemned for “self-mutilation”, though Jeunet and his Amélie star, Audrey Tautou, were more interested in romantic serendipity than anti-war sentiment.) By contrast, Jean Renoir’s 1937 standard Grand Illusion comes around to an anti-war message through a subtler assessment of leaders on both sides of the conflict, whose class connections to each other run deeper than nationalist animosity. There are shades of The Great Escape to the story of French officers who politely yet insistently attempt to break free of the aristocratic German (Erich von Stroheim) who’s holding them captive. Yet the conditions for these prisoners of war aren’t exactly dire – they stage a rousing vaudeville-style performance in drag – and the conversation turns to a lament over Europe’s collapsing social order, which presages even more tragedy to come. What stands out in Grand Illusion is Renoir’s humane treatment of all parties: War is an unnatural state, stoked by a nationalist fervor that dissolves when people are in a room together. Even a film as pitiless and lacerating as Paths of Glory comes to the same conclusion in its final moments, when French soldiers gather at an inn and start to heckle and catcall a frightened German woman as she sings The Faithful Hussar, only to respond deeply to her vulnerability. What’s touching about the great first world war movies is their attempt to find meaning in small acts of courage and friendships under duress, when a salvageable moment or relationship transcends the cynicism, chaos and death that defined the war itself. As a documentary postscript to these films, Peter Jackson’s miraculous digital reclamation project, They Shall Not Grow Old, winds up reinforcing their observations with real testimony from the men who actually lived through it. Drawing images, footage, and audio from the Imperial War Museum and other sources – revivified further by advances in visual and sound effects – Jackson brings these old ghosts to life in a chorus of shared experience. The film is an emotional history rather than a record of important dates or key battles, full of specific memories and plainspoken laments. No one cared to hear from them when it mattered.
There are two sorts of movie stars, and the demands of the market are such that the first type must occasionally pretend to be the second type. The first type is the critical darling, accomplished thespians who command crowds of screaming admirers at Cannes even though they may not be household names. They appear in glowingly reviewed indies and attract the attention of international auteurs, regularly landing on year-end best-of lists and awards lineups. They inspire rapturous reviews filled with flowery prose about nuance and subtlety, the exquisite artistry of the acting craft, et cetera. The second type is the box-office champion, a known entity perhaps lacking in a certain prestige who nonetheless stands atop the world of pop culture. These are our Dwayne Johnsons and Kevin Harts, our Rebel Wilsons and, soon perhaps, our Emilia Clarkes. They lead tentpole releases, put cheeks in seats and keep the studio coffers full. And it is because the flow of that money has tributaries diverting into the talent’s bank account that the first type of movie star is often compelled to try their hand as the second type. There’s an envy that cuts both ways, whether one sort of star covets the other half’s esteem or pay rates, but the key difference is that a person wants respect and needs money. It’s a lot easier for an actor to afford participation in those low-budget passion projects when there’s a comforting lump sum in their savings, not to mention that those films are more likely to hook viewers if the star’s been in something recognizable of late. It is because there’s a considerable overlap between these two modes of fame that the expression “one for me, one for them” was coined to articulate how versatile stars navigate their creative whims with the imperatives of the biz. Enter Kristen Stewart, a star who’s spent more of the last decade on “for me” than “for them”. She arrived on the scene as a star in the box-office draw mold, making a name for herself as a lip-biting heartthrob in the Twilight franchise, and then went about proving just how much more she was capable of. She tackled literary adaptations like On the Road and worked with such renowned auteurs as Olivier Assayas, Kelly Reichardt and Woody Allen. (Though he’s really only renowned in some parts of the world these days, mostly France, where Stewart became the first American female actor to win a Cesar award, their equivalent of the Oscar.) She shrugged off most of the spotlight on her, bristling during the interviews in which she expressed a desire to do her work without attracting the glare of attention. But to get the more meaningful movies financed and in the black once they’re released, it helps to recharge one’s star-power batteries every now and then, and that much has presented a complicated obstacle to Stewart. The past few months have seen her attempting to shore up her presence on the A-list with a pair of big-budget studio jobs in the Elizabeth Banks-directed reboot of Charlie’s Angels, and this weekend’s sci-fi/horror spectacle Underwater. In them, she does things she doesn’t often do on screen: deliver snappy one-liners, dispatch men twice her size in hand-to-hand combat, strap into cybernetic scuba-armor, do battle with CGI monstrosities from the briny deep. She’s straying from the arthouse and re-entering neighborhood cineplexes, and as in the hostile depths of the Mariana Trench that set the scene for Underwater, the terrain hasn’t always been friendly. Charlie’s Angels drew dire notices and barely broke even, and although Underwater has inspired slightly more positive reviews, its quiet rollout from Fox and its early January premiere date foretell an underwhelming showing. In both instances, Stewart’s turning in strong work, as a winning smart aleck in the former and a steely action hero in the latter. But her presence doesn’t mesh with the whole of the project in either instance. In Charlie’s Angels, she’s acting smarter than the movie around her, and in Underwater, she’s exuding a quiet intensity at odds with the B-movie “Ridley Scott’s Alien, but beneath the waves” premise. She’s doing better work than the movie deserves, the same issue that led to hordes of chuckleheads exiting the Twilight years under the impression Stewart was an un-emotive rather than a subtle actor. (Curiously enough, her old co-star Robert Pattinson is going through a similar process now, pinning his hopes at re-establishing his selling power with middlebrow America on his upcoming gig as Batman.) It’s for this reason she stuck out like a talented sore thumb in 2012’s Snow White and the Huntsman, a film that made her out to be a more ordinary onscreen quantity than she allows herself to be. She’s never been able to plug herself into a proper blockbuster, but she hasn’t let that stop her from excelling. Stewart has been doing her duty and working the press circuit for these marquee titles, and yet she’s moving through it all like a visitor. Her true homeland is several steps away from the mainstream, where her reserved acting style of facial tics and expressive stillness can flourish. Sounds like that’s the direction in which she’s once again headed; her next role on the docket will be in Clea DuVall’s independent production Happiest Season, about a lesbian couple preparing to break the news of their love to one half’s conservative parents. Here’s hoping that with her tour of duty completed, the years to come will bring more roles suited to her particular set of skills. A star with not just the depth of a Kristen Stewart, but the inclination to exercise it in films that push her to consistently challenge herself, is a terrible thing to waste.
Readers of the Washington Post have found a way to watch Cats, the big-screen adaptation of the famous musical that’s reckoned to have lost more than $100m since it was released last month and which many critics have lambasted as virtually unwatchable. Hundreds of people told the Post about seeing the Tom Hooper-directed movie tripped out on magic mushrooms, LSD, spiked marijuana and other mind-altering substances. The paper offered a list of compelling, if not encouraging, responses: “The most terrifying experience of my life. I swear to God my soul escaped me.” “Cried both times. Planning on going two more times.” “Vomited four times but ultimately understood the film on a deep level.” “Had a panic attack in the middle of it …” Raina, 25, from South Carolina, said she couldn’t handle the mismatched proportions of the furry animals. She lasted 10 minutes, “and then I went to the AMC bathroom and threw up”. Annaliese Nielsen, terrified by the furry face of James Corden, called the film “a special kind of evil”. Audience responses are in some ways more severe than the critics, who widely slammed the adaptation when it was released over Christmas. The film, wrote Matt Golder at Collider, “feels like it’s two seconds away from turning into a furry orgy in a dumpster”. Still, one Post reader described a “bonding experience” with other viewers at a New York theater. “Just like, OK, we’re doing this together, this is a thing that is transpiring, and we are bearing witness.”
It was a night of stratospherically high star-wattage – Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt, Leonardo DiCaprio, Taylor Swift, Beyonce, Elton John, the list goes on – and big wins for British productions at the 77th Golden Globes, a night overstuffed with largely unsurprising awards, host Ricky Gervais’s apathy toward award shows, and calls to vote in 2020. Top of the British victory wave was 1917, Sam Mendes’s technically audacious film following two British soldiers in the first world war, which won for best picture – drama and best director. Best actor – drama, meanwhile, went to Joaquin Phoenix for Joker, who gave a rambling speech frequently obscured with network bleeps. Renee Zellweger won best actress in a drama for Judy. On the comedy/musical side, the night tipped in favor of Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood and its supporting actor star Brad Pitt, as well as Brit Taron Egerton for his portrayal of Sir Elton John in Rocketman. It was also a night of historic firsts with The Farewell star Awkwafina becoming the first Asian-American woman to win for best actress in a musical or comedy (“If I fall on hard times, I can sell this,” joked the first-time Golden Globes attendee) and composer Hildur Guðnadóttir winning best score for Joker, becoming the first woman to win solo in the category. On the television side, the Globes extended the Emmys’ British invasion with numerous wins for stars from across the pond – Phoebe Waller-Bridge continued her awards season roll with best actress and best comedy for Fleabag, Olivia Colman ruled again for her takeover of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, and Brian Cox triumphed as best actor in a drama for Succession, whose British creator Jesse Armstrong picked up a win for best drama series. Uncharacteristically for the Globes, the television wins largely tracked with critical acclaim or consensus; besides wins for the much-lauded Fleabag and Succession, awards went to the well-reviewed Chernobyl and its star Stellan Skarsgaard for supporting actor in a limited series, and what could be seen as a “best new artist” award to Ramy Youssef for his role in Hulu’s small but mighty series Ramy. The over-three hour telecast kicked off with a typically caustic routine from five-time host Ricky Gervais, who took aim at Hollywood’s ties to Jeffrey Epstein (“I know he’s your friend, but I don’t care”), film and TV executives who are “all terrified of Ronan Farrow,” and The Morning Show’s theme of morality, “which is rich coming from a company [Apple] that runs sweat shops in Asia”. Blasting stars’ enthusiasm to work for massive streaming companies, Gervais told the crowd to not use their speeches “as a platform to make a political speech”, and instead “come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God, and fuck off”. Several of the winners pointedly ignored Gervais’s advice; the night’s two most rousing speeches belonged to veteran speech-givers Patricia Arquette and Michelle Williams. Arquette, accepting for a repeat win as best supporting actress in a limited series for The Act, urged viewers to look past the pomp toward real issues. “While I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world,” she said. “For our kids and their kids we have to vote in 2020 and we have to get – beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.” Williams, accepting for best actress in limited series for Fosse/Verdon, built on her memorable Emmys speech on giving space for women to do their best work with a moving call for women’s right to choose. “I’ve tried my very best to live a life of my own making and not just a series of events that happened to me, but one that I can stand back and look at and recognize my handwriting all over,” she said – choices not possible without her right, as a woman, to “choose when to have my children and with whom, when I felt supported and able to balance our lives, knowing, as all mothers know, the scales must and will tip towards our children”. She concluded by calling on women “18 to 118”, to vote in their self-interest, because “it’s what men have been doing for years, which is why the world looks so much like them – but don’t forget we are the largest voting body in this country. Let’s make it look more like us.” The night’s other most resonant speeches belonged to the evening’s two lifetime honorees: Ellen Degeneres, accepting the Carol Burnett award for achievement in television from Kate McKinnon, who described the impact the comedian’s coming out had on her as a young woman, and America’s great everyman, Tom Hanks, introduced for the Cecil B DeMille by Charlize Theron as, simply, a man who “makes the world a better place”. Phoenix also took a political, if slightly less coherent than Arquette and Williams, stance in his speech. “It’s really nice that so many people have sent their well wishes to Australia but we have to do more than that,” he said, referencing the country’s devastating bush fires. “I have not always been a virtuous man. So many of you in this room have given me so many opportunities to get it right … Together, hopefully we can be unified and make some changes,” such as, he added, not taking a private jet to Palm Springs. Fire and politics take centre stage at Golden Globes – video The climate change-fueled disaster in Australia received much attention throughout the night; best supporting actor in a limited series Russell Crowe wasn’t in attendance due to the fires, sending word instead to take climate action seriously, while Aussie native Cate Blanchett thanked well-wishers and urged for donations to first responders and those affected by the raging bushfires, because “when one country faces a climate disaster, we all face a climate disaster”. Even Gervais had to agree, ending the night with a call to “get drunk, take your drugs, and also: donate to Australia.”
Betting odds predict the loudest sounds of cheering and popping corks in Los Angeles on Sunday night will come from inside the Beverly Hilton Hotel. For this is where HBO and WarnerMedia – makers of Succession, Big Little Lies and Chernobyl – are due to celebrate after scooping many of the top prizes at the Golden Globe awards. But whoever really does win big, it is certain the mood will also be pretty jubilant next door on Wilshire Boulevard at Circa 55, the poolside restaurant where Netflix is holding a party to mark its own extraordinary awards showing. The streaming channel and production house dominates proceedings this year, with a total of 34 nominations. It has notched up 17 in both the film and the television categories. Alongside its critically acclaimed feature-length hits, such as Martin Scorsese’s epic The Irishman and Noah Baumbach’s Marriage Story, the sheer number of original television shows which have been made by Netflix has ensured it a place in most of the small-screen-award categories. Among its contenders for glory are the third season of the prestige juggernaut The Crown, starring Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth and Helena Bonham Carter as Princess Margaret, and the new, gritty mini-series, Unbelievable. Both shows have received four nominations each. The gentle American comedy The Kominsky Method, starring Michael Douglas as a vintage acting coach and Alan Arkin as his jaded agent, has earned three, while the new high school show, The Politician, has two chances to help Netflix walk away with a trophy. After only six years of producing drama, the rise of Netflix has been astonishing. It grabbed audience attention early on with its successful show House of Cards, and two years ago it first managed to beat the experienced studio machine at HBO with a long tally of Emmy nominations. Last year, however, HBO was back in the lead once again, by a distance of 20 nominations, and the studio and American satellite and cable channel eventually claimed six more prizes than Netflix. This weekend, as the Golden Globes kicks off the 2020 awards calendar, Netflix has outstripped everyone else with the sheer number of starters that it has placed in the field, despite the fact that HBO has been judged likely to take home at least six of the 11 trophies to be handed out for television shows later tonight. The 77th Golden Globes awards, which was voted for by 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, will be presented this year by the British comic actor and standup Ricky Gervais, who has done the job four times already. Last year Andy Samberg and Sandra Oh did the honours. In America the ceremony, a notoriously unruly younger brother to next month’s Oscars’ shindig, will go out live on NBC, an old-fashioned broadcast channel. The fact that streaming-channel shows, of the kind offered by newcomers Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, FX and Apple TV Plus, have now pushed out most of the other TV drama contenders, is the cause of some industry embarrassment. As Variety, the showbusiness trade journal, has pointed out, it is an uncomfortable and possibly unsustainable situation for a mainstream broadcast channel to be putting out an awards show that congratulates the makers of dramas its own viewers cannot watch. It is true, of course, that there has always been a gap between the views of critics and those of the general public. But the divide is now also between the privileged few who have seen all of the competing shows and those who have only heard of them. As streaming services do not yet release their ratings figures, or the number of downloads, it could be that not many of those watching the Golden Globes will have ever seen Unbelievable, or Apple’s The Morning Show, which is hotly tipped to win an award for Jennifer Aniston. Similarly in Britain, the much-nominated HBO show Succession, which has been acclaimed for British writer Jesse Armstrong’s bleak and funny storytelling and which stars British actors Brian Cox and Matthew Macfadyen, can only be seen by Sky subscribers.
As the founder of one of the very few UK companies that specialise in making and distributing independent cinema documentaries, I read with interest that Peter Bradshaw (Opinion, theguardian.com, 27 December) is unhappy about the state of documentaries at the end of the decade. Saying that he was now seeing documentaries that “feel lightweight, sometimes almost negligible”, he lamented the failure of documentaries to reflect the austerity of the last 10 years, suggesting that the reason may be “too many documentarians chasing too few genuinely strong subjects”. From where I sit, I see no shortage of strong subjects, with committed film-makers wanting to make films that address them, and over the last 10 years, Dartmouth has been able to bring some of these films to the British public, many of which have been generously reviewed by Bradshaw – one of the few critics to treat independent British film seriously. What I do see is a shortage of money to make these films so film-makers have a chance of making a reasonable living. As British television has progressively withdrawn from commissioning heavyweight documentaries, no other significant source of funding of documentary films and film-makers has emerged. (The BFI Doc Society Fund does good work, but it is small compared with the budgets of the broadcasters.) Through ingenuity, good fortune and (most significantly) the extraordinary commitment of film-makers, we have been able to find ways of funding and distributing the sorts of documentaries that Bradshaw wants to see. But for this model to be reproduced and turned into the basis of a sustainable part of the creative industries, there needs to be a much better understanding among policymakers and potential funders of the cultural,social and economic importance of documentaries – and the financial realities of making them. Let’s hope that the important study being undertaken into the documentary industry at the University of the West of England, due to report this year, will play a big educative role in this regard. 
There’s a scene toward the end of Greta Gerwig’s adaptation of Little Women, a starry-eyed update of Louisa May Alcott’s 19th-century novels, in which headstrong Jo (Saoirse Ronan), the character Alcott modeled on herself, anticipates decades of female creative doubt. A writer struggling to produce the popular, contrived sentimental stories of her day and slogging even harder to figure out what she wants to write, Jo doubts the ability of her own life experience to be compelling, asking her sisters: “Who will be interested in a story of domestic struggles and joys? It doesn’t have any real importance.” To which Amy (Florence Pugh), the youngest, responds: “Maybe we don’t see these things as important because no one writes about them.” Writing things, she says, “is what makes them important.” There are numerous moments in Gerwig’s Little Women that feel as though they’re speaking directly to a young girl’s ambition before, as Amy says, the world is hard on it, but this is, for me, the most poignant one, with a point that I have had to learn over and over: your stories aren’t seen as unimportant because they’re just your life; they only seem unimportant because of years of shunting off women’s stories as a side genre, or of diminishing personal stories as vain, or of not seeing those stories at all. That Jo needed such validation both as Alcott’s avatar in the 1860s and as a prismatic onscreen presence in 2019 feels indicative of a familiar rut that, despite a slate of trailblazing, complex and straight-up enjoyable female-driven films and TV this year, we still seem stuck in: the internal doubt that your story is interesting, or the larger one that no one will take it seriously. Gerwig sent up that doubt to devastatingly beautiful effect in Lady Bird, a film that felt genuinely revelatory to me; at the time, I didn’t realize that the story of a suburban-ish high school girl in the 2000s with a personal relationship to the song Crash Into Me (by Dave Matthews Band) could be movie-worthy, let alone “good” cinema. In Little Women, Gerwig applies that rare confidence to well-mined and beloved source material, infusing the March sisters – Meg (Emma Watson), Jo (Ronan), Beth (Eliza Scanlen) and Amy (Pugh) – with a recognizably 21st century candor on the limitations, crossroads and ambitions of 19th century womanhood (in white, genteel poverty New England). Jo is particularly strident; she chafes at marriage, moves to New York City by herself to make it as a writer, negotiates her own contracts – all while tipping into doubt of her own ability to make it, to speak as herself publicly. Jo’s doubt seems prescient, even meta – though the film has made over $50m since its release Christmas Day and been heaped with critical praise, it’s already been undervalued in awards season; male voters, it seems, don’t think a coming-of-age story centered on women is for them. And it makes Little Women perhaps a fitting cap to the year 2019 for women in film, a year in which a slate of female-driven and directed movies topped the box office – Hustlers, directed by Lorene Scafaria, raked in over $156m this fall – or received critical acclaim and attention (Lulu Wang’s The Farewell, Marielle Heller’s A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood). And yet the pillars of acclaim in the industry – awards, at once irrelevant and its own cottage industry of symbolic importance – still almost never reward female-directed films, or films about women at all. After Little Women, despite critical raves (it currently has a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes) failed to secure key nominations from the Golden Globes (Saoirse Ronan and Alexandre Desplat got nods for best actress and best score, respectively) or Screen Actors Guild nominations, Vanity Fair reported on the movie’s “Little Man” problem: male voters just weren’t viewing the film. “It’s a completely unconscious bias. I don’t think it’s anything like a malicious rejection,” the Little Women producer Amy Pascal told Vanity Fair. “[Voters think], ‘These kinds of stories are important to me, and these kinds of stories are less important to me.’” According to Pascal, attendance of Little Women screenings in LA favored women two to one. That viewership skew extended to theaters – the film’s opening day audience was 70% female, according to Box Office Mojo, with 71% aged 25 or older. The “Little Man” problem explains, in part, why we’re seeing this weird discrepancy now, this dissonance, in which female-driven, directed and starring features and television are gaining increasing visibility and cultural clout – as in many public circles, the promotion of feminism and female perspectives is heralded as an indisputably good thing – yet still this change is not reflected in the most prominent arbiters of cinematic “taste”. There are no women nominated for best director at the Golden Globes this year, despite a plethora of options (Scafaria, Gerwig, Wang, Heller). There have only been five women ever nominated for a best director Oscar, Gerwig among them for Lady Bird, and just one winner: Kathryn Bigelow in 2010 for The Hurt Locker. It’s not just behind the camera; a survey of the past 40 years in Oscar prizes uncovers a dismal lack of female-driven storytelling. The closest one gets to a female-led narrative for best picture is Terms of Endearment in 1983, Jodie Foster’s lead role in The Silence of the Lambs in 1991, or Chicago in 2002. This year’s Oscar conversation is mostly circling Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon A Time in Hollywood and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman – solidly made films in which women are an afterthought to the story, at best. The point is not that awards are the arbiter of progress, or that they should be determined based on representation. But they do confer importance, even if that importance is sometimes misplaced or clearly and self-reinforcingly lopsided. It’s trite to say that awards are irrelevant to the quality of the movies; they’re as relevant as we or, really, the financiers of movies make them. But they do hold a mold of what is considered good, serious, “important” cinema, which still says: men’s stories are the primary stories, the default setting, the norm. Everything else is a deviation. And that tucks in another assumption: female audiences will of course watch a movie outside of their perspective, but don’t expect it to go the other way. When Pascal recalled to Vanity Fair the tepid reaction from male studio executives to the 1994 version of Little Women, which she pushed at the time as vice-president of production at Columbia Pictures, she remembered the shrugs then weren’t all that surprising then, but “I didn’t think 25 years later it would be quite so similar.” Looking at the numbers, it’s not quite so surprising. According to a new study from the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, the number of top-grossing pictures from female directors since 2007 has stayed around 4.8% – a ratio of 20 male directors to every female one. Though some studios in recent years have had multiple projects made by women, some have passed the buck – Paramount has not made a single picture with a female film-maker in five years. The horizon, however, seems brighter. The same study called 2019 a “real moment” for diversity in film. The number of female-directed top 100 films is now around 10% – certainly not gender parity but over double from 2018. A slate of female-directed films across genres are expected to top the box office in 2020, from Disney’s live-action Mulan to four major superhero movies: Birds of Prey, Black Widow (starring Little Women’s Pugh), Wonder Woman 1984 and Eternals. We may still have to remind ourselves – some, of course, with much higher barriers than others – that women’s stories are worth telling, but Jo, Gerwig and audiences have long understood their importance, even if Hollywood has lagged behind.
The number of women working in the film industry reached a historic high in 2019, but men still outnumber women four to one in key roles. Women made up 20% of behind-the-scenes roles on the top 100 domestic grossing films of 2019, a sharp uptick from 16% in 2018, a study by the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego University revealed. However, when it comes to key jobs like director and cinematographer, men continue to dominate. “It’s odd to talk about reaching historic highs when women remain so far from parity,” said Martha Lauzen, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film. The center has been running the annual study, “Celluloid Ceiling”, since 1997. This year, the review for the first time included numbers for oft-overlooked roles such as composers, music supervisors and visual effects supervisors in addition to more prominent positions. The team found strongholds and troubling shortcomings. Women accounted for 43% of music supervisors on the top 500 films released in 2019 and 27% of producer roles, but only for 2% of cinematography roles on the top 100 films released. “I think it’s important to recognize that women’s underemployment extends far beyond directors, writers, producers, editors and cinematographers,” Lauzen said. “Inequality reaches into every facet and corner of the business.” Lauzen believes it isn’t a coincidence that women fare worse in the traditionally male-identified roles. “When we think about what a director or cinematographer looks like, when we see those pictures inside our heads, typically they are of a white male. We can’t discount the impact these subconscious images have on hiring decisions. People tend to hire others who look like they do.” “Celluloid Ceiling” comes on the eve of awards season, and amid growing concerns Hollywood award committees will not continue the upward trend of recognizing women in film this year. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association faced backlash when its nominations in the best director category did not include any women directors, in a year replete with strong contenders such as Greta Gerwig (Little Women), Lulu Wang (The Farewell), and Olivia Wilde (Booksmart). “We don’t vote by gender. We vote by film and accomplishment,” Lorenzo Soria, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, told Variety when pressed about the absence of women directors. Prominent female actors are leading the charge in changing the status-quo. As part of the Time Up’s campaign, launched in 2017, Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Lopez, Tessa Thompson and others made public pledges to work with women directors. Since then, Kidman has starred in over five films directed by women and Lopez starred in the critically-acclaimed stripper drama, Hustlers, directed by Lorene Scarfia. But Lauzen cautions that this year’s “Celluloid Ceilings” findings show it’s crucial not to become distracted by marquee female-led films and directors and assume the battle for gender parity is won. “It’s easy to think things have improved dramatically when we see high-profile women such as Patty Jenkins and Marielle Heller directing films or when we hear that women are set to direct five superhero studio features in 2020,” Lauzen says. “A few high-profile cases can dramatically skew our perceptions of how women are faring. That’s why it’s so important to count the numbers of women working, so that we’re not acting on perceptions but on reality.”
The first transgender character in a Marvel movie will probably appear in a film released next year. Speaking at an event at the New York Film Academy, Marvel president Kevin Feige said that a trans superhero would appear in a film “very soon, in a movie that we’re shooting right now”. He said that more transgender characters will feature in the future. Such a development was expected from the post-Avengers: Infinity War iteration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with many expecting that the character will debut in Thor: Love and Thunder, released in 2021. Fans have speculated that the only existing character who fits the bill exists in the Thor universe: Sera, who descends from a group of all-male angels but who has transitioned to a female identity. Last summer, reports emerged that Marvel was planning to cast a transgender woman in Thor: Love and Thunder, to be filmed this year. A full cast list for the film has not yet been released, but it will be directed by Taika Waititi and see the return of series regulars Chris Hemsworth, Natalie Portman and Tessa Thompson. Thompson’s character Valkyrie, who identifies as bisexual, was crowned the new king in the last Avengers film. Thompson has said her “first order of business” in Love and Thunder will be “to find her queen”. This November sees the release of The Eternals, which will introduce a new Marvel ensemble cast including Angelina Jolie, Richard Madden, Kit Harington, Kumail Nanjiani, Salma Hayek and Brian Tyree Henry. The film, about an ancient race whose powers derive from alien experiments, will introduce Marvel movies’ first gay character. Richard Madden will play Ikaris, “a levitating immortal with teleporting and vaporising powers and abundance of cosmic energy” who also, said Feige, is “married, he’s got a family, and that is just part of who he is.” Marvel’s first deaf superhero will feature in the same film, while its first Asian-American superhero will come in 2021, with Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings. Disney’s track record on LGBT representation came in for renewed criticism after a hotly billed same-sex relationship in the latest Star Wars film turned out to be a fleeting kiss between two women – one of whom was never introduced – in the background of a single scene. Some fans sensed that a long-brewing connection between Oscar Isaac’s Poe and John Boyega’s Finn had been censored, with Isaac conceding that “the Disney overlords were not ready to do that”. Avengers: Endgame and Beauty and the Beast also included gay characters but these too did not involve leading characters, and scenes were cut from versions of the film shown in some countries. A lesbian kiss in Star Wars: The Last Jedi was also edited out of showings in Singapore and Dubai. Some activists have been angered by what they perceive as the studio paying lip service to diversity while ensuring final products can screen as widely as possible.
Cats appears set to make movie hiss-tory – as a major box office failure for Universal Pictures. The critically panned film, which had a reported budget of $95m (£72m), made only $6.62m (£5m) during its opening weekend and is projected to lose Universal at least $70m (£53m), the LA Times reports – while Deadline reports the project could lose at least $71m (£54m) and Variety reports it could lose up to $100m (£76m). This would make the film one of the biggest box office flops of 2019. The news comes after Universal hit the brakes on its Oscars campaign for Cats, quietly pulling the film from its “for your consideration” page. Meanwhile, the film’s own stars are distancing themselves. During an interview, James Corden, who plays Bustopher Jones, admitted he has not seen the film and “heard it’s terrible”. Before the film’s premiere, Taylor Swift and Jennifer Hudson repeatedly emphasized how they had not seen the film and signed on “for the journey”. Failure at the box office is likely to come as a surprise to Universal. As industry experts point out, movie musicals have become cash-cows for studios in recent years. Bohemian Rhapsody earned over $900m(£680m) globally, Les Misérables $441m (£333m), and The Greatest Showman, a sleeper hit, $435m (£329m). Such past successes make it clear that Cats has failed to connect with audiences, or at least not in a good way. Negative reviews of the film, however, have become almost an art form. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw skewered the film in a review written completely in verse (taking inspiration from the poetry of TS Eliot, the source material for Cats). He writes: “As they gaze at the greenscreen and sashay and crawl/ It’s weird to behold them all gurning and acting/And why do so many resemble Darth Maul?” Other critics have described it as “a descent into madness” and a “sight no humans should see”. Overall, Cats’ chances of redemption do not look paw-sitive.
The American actor Zac Efron has confirmed he recently fell ill while filming a survival reality TV show in Papua New Guinea. Australian media had reported that Efron, 32, was flown by helicopter for treatment in Australia after contracting a bacterial infection, possibly typhoid, while shooting the Killing Zac Efron series. In a post on Monday on his official Twitter account, accompanied by a photograph of him in Papua New Guinea, Efron said he was back home “for the holidays with my friends and family”. “Very thankful to everyone who has reached out,” his post said. “I did get sick in Papua New Guinea but I bounced back quick and finished an amazing 3 weeks in PNG“ Glenn McKay, a doctor with the Medical Rescue Group, told the Daily Telegraph on Sunday he could not discuss confidential patient information, but could confirm “that Medical Rescue retrieved a US citizen in his 30s from PNG to Brisbane recently for medical attention”. The newspaper reported that doctors allowed Efron to fly home to Los Angeles on Christmas Eve. Typhoid fever is transmitted by contaminated food and water, and kills 216,000 to 600,000 people worldwide each year. Killing Zac Efron is billed as an adventure series in which the star ventures “deep into the jungles of a remote, dangerous island to carve his own name in expedition history”. The series was commissioned by the short content platform Quibi, which is scheduled to launch in April. Efron had previously posted images on social media showing him in a canoe on PNG’s Sepik River and travelling to Yanchan Village to see a traditional skin-cutting ceremony.
Sue Lyon, who at age 14 played the title character in the 1962 film adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov’s controversial novel Lolita, has died at age 73. Longtime friend Phil Syracopoulos told The New York Times she died on Thursday in Los Angeles. He gave no cause of death. Director Stanley Kubrick reportedly selected the young and inexperienced Lyon to play Lolita – a 12-year-old in Nabokov’s book who enters into a relationship with a middle-aged literature professor – from among 800 aspirants. After her casting, Nabokov described Lyon as the “perfect nymphet”. The older man obsessed with the girl he calls “Lolita” was played by English actor James Mason, who was 53 when the film was shot. Lyon’s performance won her a 1963 Golden Globe as most promising female newcomer. Kubrick later said his battles with motion picture censors – who insisted he tone down the movie’s sexual underpinnings and huge age difference – were so fierce that he would not have made the film had he known. Lyon was 15 when the movie premiered – too young to be allowed into the theatre to watch it. She was famously photographed sipping a drink at a nearby soda fountain during the premiere. The film’s iconic poster shows Lyon, looking up seductively over heart-shaped sunglasses and licking a red lollipop, under the legend: “How did they ever make a movie of LOLITA?” Lyon went on to compile several other screen and television credits, including a role in John Huston’s The Night of the Iguana in which she played a young woman stuck in a small Mexican town who tries to seduce a disgraced Episcopal priest played by Richard Burton, and John Ford’s final feature film 7 Women, which was released in 1966. But she never again achieved the fame or notoriety that Lolita brought her. Lyon’s last acting role was in 1980 horror film Alligator, in which she played a reporter. She was married five times; she blamed her brief marriage to convicted murderer Gary “Cotton” Adamson for severely damaging her career. Lyon is survived by a daughter, Nona.
After 85 years as one of the most famous names in Hollywood, Disney is calling time on the Fox in 20th Century Fox with executives reportedly worried the name had become too closely associated with Rupert Murdoch’s rightwing news channel. Variety reported Friday that the 20th Century Fox film studio will become 20th Century Studios, and Fox Searchlight Pictures will become Searchlight Pictures. Company emails have already been changed and Downhill, a remake of Swedish hit Force Majeure starring Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell, will next month become the first film released as a Foxless Searchlight production. Walt Disney bought most of Murdoch’s entertainment assets last year in a $71.3bn deal, including the 20th Century Fox studio and Fox Searchlight. The Murdoch family kept control of Fox News and their sports business. The 20th Century Fox brand was formed by the merger of Twentieth Century Pictures and Fox Film Corporation in 1935. Its famous searchlight logo has shone before some of the biggest movies in Hollywood history, including Alien, Avatar, Die Hard, Home Alone and Planet of the Apes. Murdoch took control of 20th Century Fox in the mid 1980s and built a media empire under the Fox brand that is now heavily associated with its news network. “I think the Fox name means Murdoch, and that is toxic,” an insider told Variety.
The announcement of a casting call for children aged nine to 11, “no taller than 4ft 3in”, has confirmed that a film of Roald Dahl’s Matilda is in the works. It will be directed by Matthew Warchus, who staged the hit musical adaptation for the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford in 2010. Matilda has since become one of the longest-running musicals in the West End. According to the advertisement, the movie – produced by Working Title Films – will be shot from August to December. The character description for the telekinetic bookworm heroine states: “Matilda is not quick to smile, nor sentimental … She has had quite a tough life so far, and not much help from the adults around her; she is able to meet her own needs quite proficiently, she is a survivor.” No acting experience is required from hopeful candidates, “just an instinctive approach to speaking text with an inquisitive mind, a good singing voice and some movement skills”. The musical, with songs by Tim Minchin including the showstopper When I Grow Up, was adapted from Roald Dahl’s bestselling novel by Dennis Kelly. Dahl’s book has already been adapted as a movie: in 1996, Danny DeVito directed a version starring Mara Wilson in the title role. DeVito narrated the film and played Matilda’s despicable father, Mr Wormwood, with DeVito’s wife, Rhea Perlman, playing the equally awful Mrs Wormwood. Kerry Ingram (Shireen Baratheon in Game of Thrones) and Cleo Demetriou (So Awkward) are among the actors who played Matilda in the musical in the UK. The show also triumphed on Broadway and toured to Australia, New Zealand and China. Its first non-English language production was in Seoul, South Korea, in 2018.
Taika Waititi, director of Jojo Rabbit and Thor: Ragnarok, has been invited to develop a Star Wars film feature project, according to reports. Citing unnamed film industry sources, the Hollywood Reporter said that New Zealander Waititi has been approached by Lucasfilm to join the franchise that recently wrapped up its third film trilogy with the release of Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. It is not clear whether Waititi will develop his own project, or if he will be part of one already in progress under Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige, with whom Waititi is currently collaborating on the fourth Thor film, Thor: Love and Thunder. However, Waititi is already connected to Star Wars production having directed the eighth and final episode of the Disney+ spin-off TV series The Mandalorian. Waititi’s involvement in Star Wars may also signal that the projected trilogy from The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson will not see the light of day. Little concrete information about the Johnson trilogy has emerged since it was announced in 2017, and the director appears now to be concentrating on a sequel to his hit crime comedy Knives Out. In a recent non-committal remark, Johnson said: “I’m still talking to Lucasfilm [about Star Wars] but they haven’t announced anything on their slate yet.” Game of Thrones creators David Benioff and DB Weiss dropped out of their projected Star Wars trilogy last year. Waititi, who was recently Oscar-nominated for best adapted screenplay and best picture among six nods for Jojo Rabbit, is currently working on football comedy Next Goal Wins, before starting production on Thor: Love and Thunder, for planned release in 2021.
‘Oh, I’m a bumper!” says Kathy Bates as I reach out to shake her hand. A small fist comes towards me with a large, round, pink-rose ring on the middle finger. We bump and laugh and one of the truly unique American acting powerhouses of the past half-century beams back at me. She has a splendid smile, full of mischief and wisdom: a small and compact woman buoyed by that straight-up, unfeigned southern warmth that abides no matter where you encounter it. She fusses over me kindly, offering drinks – a world away from the nervous, shy, deeply rattled and easily hurt woman I have just watched in Clint Eastwood’s new movie, Richard Jewell. Bates plays Bobi, the mother of the eponymous character, a security guard at the 1996 Olympics in Centennial Park, Atlanta, who discovered a backpack full of pipe-bombs, laid by white-supremacist terrorist Eric Rudolph, minutes before it exploded. Although one person died and 111 were injured, Jewell saved countless lives by clearing the area before the bombs exploded. But within days he found himself under a nationwide spotlight as the FBI focused on him as their chief suspect. For 88 days, he and his mother endured a press siege outside their shared apartment – and a vicious feeding-frenzy in the national media – until the FBI halfheartedly admitted he hadn’t planted the bomb. Almost a decade later, Rudolph confessed in a plea bargain to avoid the death penalty. Jewell enjoyed only a brief vindication though, dying of heart failure aged 44 in 2007. Eastwood’s movie is about enormous pressure being brought to bear on people unable to handle it, and Bates and Paul Walter Hauser do sterling work to delineate the suffering the pair underwent. Hauser is a good-natured fool, a fantasist deluded about his security-guard role, claiming he is “law-enforcement” even as the FBI laugh in his face. Bates’ Bobi is all nerves and near-hysteria, absorbing every blow like a woman on the verge of collapse. But her final speech, the true emotional climax of the movie, burns with a righteous fury, even as the tears fill her eyes. Eastwood needed an actor of commanding stature to deliver weakness, then rage, then fragile strength, and Bates has deservedly earned the lion’s share of the movie’s acclaim. On Monday, it earned her a fourth Oscar nomination; today she is pleased, and nostalgic for her first one, for Misery, back in 1991, which translated into a win. “I arrived home two days before the ceremony. Literally only had enough time to put on the dress. Thank God it fit. The night was a dream come true. My fiance was worried I would lose, but when Daniel Day-Lewis had the envelope in his hands, in my mind I saw my name in it. Heard him say it. Sailed up the steps and forgot to thank my fiance and my mother, who deserved all my thanks sitting at home. “This time is different,” she says, “because Richard Jewell is based on a true story. All we wanted was for Bobi Jewell to feel the film vindicated her son. I wanted her to like my portrayal of her. She’s waited 23 years for justice. I’ve never felt quite like this before. Whatever happens now, I’m just grateful the film will get more eyeballs.” Bates’ voice breaks and her breathing shortens when she speaks about the woman she plays, and with whom she made contact long before shooting started. “It was my birthday the day we met. She baked me a pound cake. She had the Vanity Fair article the movie is based on, and the script, which she’d annotated with things like: ‘I’d never do this, I’d never call him that.’ She was very meticulous. It was obvious she’s still absolutely raw from this, even 25 years later. It still affects her, and it’s never going to change.” Everybody loves Bates, but the movie – with its Trumpish overtones – has not escaped criticism. The enemies are the media and the “deep state”. The guy who gets off scot-free is Rudolph – I tell Bates that particularly disappointed me – and she seems to partly agree: “Rudolph was just evil, obviously.” She also appears sympathetic to disquiet over Olivia Wilde’s character, Kathy Scruggs, the journalist who put Jewell in the headlines in the most negative way – and is the most venomous portrayal of a woman in an Eastwood movie for many years. Scruggs died of a drug overdose aged 42, which means she can’t defend herself against the film’s claim that she slept with an FBI agent (Jon Hamm) for the scoop. “I was a little uncomfortable with her character,” says Bates, “though I think Bobi sort of balances that out in the movie.” She and Wilde didn’t share any scenes, “which was frustrating, because she’s Irish and I’m Irish, and I think Irish people make the best actors.” Bates looks for the positive. “I loved Booksmart [Wilde’s directorial debut]. She’s a brilliant director – and that counts for a lot.” This season, Bates has also admired Joker, Jojo Rabbit (“unique, heart-rending and so relevant – as is Parasite”) and Little Women. “It was absolutely delightful in every way. I adored it. I’m sick Greta Gerwig didn’t get a directing nomination. Her adaptation was incredible, but her vision as a director is on that screen in every word and moment of those performances.” She has also been trading larky congratulations – and commiserations – with Uncut Gems star Adam Sandler, who played her son in The Waterboy. “You was robbed!! But Mama loves you!!! … You da GOAT!!” she told him on Twitter. She expands, a touch more soberly: “Adam is a kind and gentle man. Friends and family are very important to him. He’s in this business, but not of it, if you get my drift.” Still, Bates’ admiration for Eastwood beats all. “I remember telling him on the set: ‘I’ve been in this business half a century but working with you, I feel like I’ve hit the big time!’” In truth, she hit that some time back. Bates made her movie debut in 1971, in Milos Forman’s Taking Off, as a singer in a crowd scene, for which she was paid $50. Her next screen role wasn’t for another seven years, but she established herself as an exciting new presence in landmark stage productions which, when they were adapted for cinema, routinely traded her for other actors: Michelle Pfeiffer, Sissy Spacek, Diane Keaton. She also received a barrage of sexist and appearance-based criticism from male critics, particularly the late Playbill critic John Simon, whose most benevolent remarks included that she was “enormously overweight” and “unattractive”. She remembers a particularly brutal British press conference for “a bad movie I was in” – probably 1991’s At Play in the Fields of the Lord. “One guy was so nasty that I went up to my room and I cried like a kid out of kindergarten. Our producer came in and said: ‘Kid, you’ve gotta get tough.’ And in the middle of everything I got on a plane and I went home. It was so cruel, so unnecessarily cruel.” Bates is circumspect in hindsight. “The thing is, you remember those moments for ever,” she says. “Even if you don’t remember the exact words, it’s a dart through the heart. But as Harold Clurman said – something it took me a long time to accept – ‘You’ve gotta have the manure, you’ve got to take all the shit to really grow.’” I remind her that when she was 41 and promoting Misery, she said: “A woman, a character actress, in her 40s – I’ll be very interested to see how Hollywood treats us over the next 10 or 15 years.” “Wow,” she says, 29 years later, “I said that? Holy crap. I didn’t know I was such a smart cookie back then! It was my first big movie and I was stunned by the press. The very first question I got asked at a round table was: ‘You’re not Michelle Pfeiffer.’ And I was like: ‘No, I’m not!’” Her face collapses into incredulity. “I was still very serious about things back then.” Bates’ position as a female actor who has long dealt with many of the issues in play, post #MeToo, gives her an unusual – and sometimes difficult – insight into how the industry has, and has not, evolved. “About people like Weinstein and the casting couch and all of that,” she says, “I have a confession. In my day, if you went up to a guy’s hotel room, you knew exactly why you were going and in those days it was consensual. Times were different, but I really support the women who are coming forward now and I’m not happy about the men who are being accused falsely – but the ones who deserve all they’re getting, my feeling is hey, go for it.” That she wasn’t a classic starlet didn’t insulate her from misogyny’s pigeonholing – right? “I hate to complain about it, but never being considered the romantic lead – which is fine, I’m over that, been there, done that – means they look at me in a different way. But then I look at my friends who are beautiful girls but not working after 40 – very few of them. Well, Nicole Kidman is … “But I’m so grateful that television is providing all these great roles for us, with people like Ryan Murphy around [the producer of American Horror Story, which has cast Bates several seasons running] we’ve been given a second life. I give Ryan a lot of credit. That show’s like being in a repertory company. Oh yes, horror has been veeeery good to me!” She chuckles like a fiend. Her movie career took off after Misery, in which she imbued her Nurse Ratched-meets-Medea character with a surprising degree of sweetness and vulnerability. So memorable – and lauded – was her performance, people have tended to conflate her with her character Annie Wilkes, even as she was busy building a gallery of richly detailed, multifarious and moving other performances, including the warm-hearted “new money” Molly Brown in 1997’s Titanic. She puts the film’s enduring appeal down to the wealth inequality at its centre: “The murder of the third-class passengers being locked below decks revealed the brutality of class struggles around the globe.” That, too, is perhaps why raft-gate persists as a debate: “We all wanted Jack to survive, and there did seem to be enough room for him to squeeze on.” Kathy Bates in About Schmidt.

A nude hot-tub scene went a long way to shake off the memory of Misery. “I think a lot of women in that audience were thrilled to see a real woman up there on the screen in all her glory,” she said at the time. Stripped of its nudity context, I suggest, that almost sounds like a proud rallying cry for the kinds of characters she takes on. “It does, doesn’t it?” she nods. “And if I’m proud of anything, it’s leaving behind me such a wide range of interesting, real women.” Not that she would rule out supernatural women, she adds. “I would love to play a character with magical abilities. I enjoy superhero movies as long as the story is well written and the characters have wit and heart, like Iron Man and Star Wars. Otherwise soulless characters in a plastic universe don’t appeal.” Today, at 71, Bates looks chipper and fit. She came through ovarian cancer in 2003, but in 2012 had a double mastectomy after being diagnosed with breast cancer. After, she suffered lymphedema – a condition that makes the arms rock-solid as lymphatic fluid drains out under the fingernails, and which, she discovered, was barely understood by medical professionals. “I dated a guy who had melanoma in his armpit and they took everything out and as a result his arm was like wood. I pleaded with my surgeon not to take any lymph nodes out.” He ignored her. Since then she has been raising awareness of lymphatic edema: “more people have it than MS, muscular dystrophy, ALS and Aids combined – and nobody knows about it.” She is the spokesperson for the Lymphatic Education & Research Network. “I spoke before the American Society of Breast Surgeons and it’s so hard to convince them – Nobel laureates! I gave them these statistics and there were gasps in that room.” Though she likes Twitter, she mostly uses it for getting the word out about the condition. “I joined in 2011 and initially used it to engage with fans and then it got to be so time-consuming that I had to cut back. Then after a couple of unpleasant experiences with fans I rarely use it and I don’t get sucked into provocative tweets.” She worries about a general “climate of hate” that’s “getting stronger in my opinion”, particularly when it comes to LGBT rights; in 2016 she was involved in a video telling the stories of victims in the Orlando shooting. “Viciousness is bred in the bone and will take generations to reverse. I worry about my gay and transgender friends.” But Bates remains a bumper to the end. Next month is going to be mostly about awards ceremonies, and one Oscar victory and two losses have left her a perennial optimist. “I learned you always think you’re going to win, the moment they announce your name.”
In an emotionally charged scene in the new movie Just Mercy, Jamie Foxx, cast as a death row prisoner named Walter McMillian, accosts the young lawyer who has taken up his case with an uncomfortable truth about being black in the deep south. “You don’t know what you’re into down here in Alabama,” he warns. “Here you’re guilty from the moment you’re born.” That phrase could stand as a catchphrase for the ingrained racial injustice that Bryan Stevenson, the rookie lawyer played in the film by Michael B Jordan, has devoted his adult life to fighting. From his first meeting with McMillian in 1988 to his star billing today as a one of America’s most incisive commentators on race and inequity – and now as a fully fledged Hollywood icon – Stevenson has never taken his eyes off the prize. His epic six-year struggle to prove McMillian an innocent man provides the narrative arc of Just Mercy. It is based on the 2014 memoir of the same name in which Stevenson, 60, relates how he came to find himself representing some of the most godforsaken prisoners in the country. He was 23 and a student at Harvard law school when his professor suggested he take an internship in Atlanta, Georgia, with a not-for-profit legal firm. The firm’s director, a towering figure in death penalty jurisprudence named Stephen Bright, took Stevenson under his wing and taught him justice, southern-style. Lesson one, Bright told him, was: “Capital punishment means, ‘Them without the capital get the punishment’.” Bright remembers his new intern as a slightly lost soul in search of a purpose in life. Those existential doubts vaporised as soon as Bright dispatched Stevenson to Alabama to investigate its death row. “When Bryan started looking into what was down there, ye gods! It was horrible!” Bright told the Guardian. “People were being sentenced to death in a perfunctory fashion represented by lawyers who had no idea what they were doing.” Bright recalls his young charge returning from a prison visit in an excited state. “This man is innocent,” Stevenson said. “I know he is innocent.” The man in question was Walter McMillian who had been sentenced to death for the 1986 murder of an 18-year-old white woman. When Stevenson began looking into the case he was struck by a legion of inconsistencies and ironies. The main irony was that the murder happened in Monroeville, home town to Harper Lee, which just went to show how much Alabama had taken to heart the moral of To Kill A Mockingbird. Even before he got going on the case, the trial judge – aptly named Robert E Lee Key – tried to talk Stevenson out of it. “Why the hell would you want to represent someone like McMillian?” the judge said. Undeterred, Stevenson began digging into the record and discovered that not only had McMillian been found guilty in a trial lasting all of two days, but the defendant had a rock-solid alibi with dozens of witnesses. The prosecution relied on a jailhouse snitch who was offered money and freedom to provide false testimony against him. Exposing the racial animus at the heart of the death penalty was not easy. There were bomb threats and many disappointments and legal setbacks along the way. But in 1993 McMillian was exonerated and walked free. As Stevenson writes in Just Mercy, “there is light within this darkness”. At this point we must say goodbye to Jamie Foxx and Michael B Jordan. It’s a measure of the exceptional nature of Stevenson that just where the movie ends – with the good guys winning their death row battle – his own story begins to get all the more interesting. Stevenson has gone on, post-McMillian, to create an entire operation dedicated to uncovering miscarriages of justice in the deep south. Back in the 1980s he had a poky office and a single assistant; today the organisation he founded, Equal Justice Initiative, employs 140 people, many of them whip-smart lawyers in his own mould. EJI has won reversals or release from prison for more than 135 wrongly convicted prisoners. Among them was Anthony Ray Hinton, who like McMillian was proven innocent in his case after 28 years on death row. Having turned EJI into a justice powerhouse, Stevenson has switched his energies to what might well become the most significant aspect of his legacy. He is now emerging as a leading exponent of America’s racial fault-line in which he has begun to join the dots between slavery, racial segregation, terror lynchings of African Americans, capital punishment and the scourge of modern mass incarceration. He has taken his hands-on experience of southern brutality – what he calls his “proximity to injustice” – and extracted from it a philosophy of the open wound that runs through American society and politics. To do that he has drawn from his roots as the great-grandson of slaves in Virginia and his experiences growing up as a black child in a small, segregated town in rural Delaware. From regular attendance at his family’s local black church he imbibed the preacher’s art of engaging an audience. You can see it in action in his Ted talk which has been viewed more than 6m times and which earned him one of the longest standing ovations in Ted’s history. Stevenson’s mission to join the dots began when he started thinking about the nature of public memorialising in Montgomery, the capital of Alabama where he set up base in the 1980s. He counted 59 Confederate markers glorifying the slave-owning south, while there was nothing to memorialise the suffering that the slave trade induced. In 2013, after a long tussle with local authorities, he managed to have three markers to the domestic slave trade erected in downtown Montgomery. From there it was but a short hop to thinking about the racial composition of death row. Why were Walter McMillian and Anthony Ray Hinton both black? Why are 42% of death row inmates today African American, when black people form just 13% of the US population? The culmination of these meditations is the National Memorial for Peace and Justice, Stevenson’s most breathtaking and audacious achievement yet. Through it he holds up a mirror to America of a central element of its character, one that until now has been almost entirely obscured – its tragic history of lynchings of more than 4,000 African Americans. The memorial, cast in bronze, sits on top of the hill that rises above Montgomery. Physically, and symbolically, it looks down on the Alabama State Capitol where so many of the political decisions that upheld white supremacy were taken – and still are taken. Standing in the centre of the memorial the power of Stevenson’s unfolding vision is almost overwhelming. From Montgomery’s slave warehouse and the thousands of men and women who died hanging from a tree, to Walter McMillian who came so close to a latter-day judicial lynching, this is America’s unfinished business, its truly strange and bitter fruit.
Nora Ephron famously felt bad about her neck. I don’t feel bad about my neck, not yet. Instead, I feel bad about Little Women. The reviews of Greta Gerwig’s film adaptation have been universally adoring. “Superb,” said Empire. “One-hundred-and-fifty-year-old literature never felt so alive,” agreed The Observer. Liking the film is now considered as much a part of being a thoughtful modern woman as supporting Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Because this movie isn’t just good, people wrote with urgency on social media – it’s important. It’s about women and creativity and it stars women – four of them! It’s an adaptation of one of the greatest women’s novels, done by Gerwig, who, like Phoebe Waller-Bridge, was decreed by The Council of General Consensus to be An Excellent Thing. As Marmee says in the book, “I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!” So I went to the cinema, as excited as if I were going on a Tinder date with Prince Charming. Hell, the algorithm guaranteed a happy ending. Louisa May Alcott’s novel was one of my favourites as a child, and like every bookish girl (what other kind reads Little Women?), I over-empathised with Jo March, the tomboy who dreams of being a writer. Also, I hugely enjoyed Lady Bird, Gerwig’s previous movie with Saoirse Ronan, who plays Jo in this version. So this film could not be more up my boulevard if it was my actual house and I lived in it. But to paraphrase another 19th-century novel much-loved by women, Reader, I did not love Little Women. Despite all the excitement, it looks as twee as the many other previous adaptations, while being more safe in the way it plays to the gallery. At the risk of being a Little Woman hipster (although all those homespun dresses they wear are quite hipster), every time someone coos over Ronan’s interpretation of Jo as an independent spirit, I can hear Katharine Hepburn, who played Jo in the 1933 version, hacking off her own hair in disgust. Much has been made of the way Gerwig has blended Alcott’s biography into the novel, ending the film with Jo publishing Little Women. This allows the director to fudge the storyline even more than she does by making Prof Bhaer, who Jo ends up marrying, a young and dishy Frenchman – as opposed to the old and ugly German he is in the book. This might be more satisfying for Jo fans, but it sands down Jo’s oddness. If Gerwig were going to change something about Bhaer, I wish she’d changed how Jo falls for him when he says her stories are rubbish. (It is amazing how many novels feature a woman getting turned on by a man telling her off, from Emma to Jane Eyre to Fifty Shades. As messages go, I’d like this to go in the bin, alongside girls being told that, when a boy pulls their hair, it means he likes them.) The novel ends with Jo and her husband opening a boys’ school, which doesn’t have quite the same feminist, individualist punch as publishing one’s own book. But imposing modern attitudes on canonical characters in the belief they must be relatable is just lazy. This happens a lot with the Bennet sisters in Pride And Prejudice, and here with the March sisters. A good literary adaptation brings us to the characters, not the other way round; in Emma Thompson’s Sense And Sensibility, Thompson and Kate Winslet don’t wang on about “the marriage economy”, as Gerwig’s Little Women do. Instead, we see how we would have thought in the 19th century. Because it’s one thing to fantasise that we are Jo, and quite another to fantasise that Jo is us. This tendency to overrelate to any fictional character, whether it’s Jo or Fleabag, is less about art and more about narcissism. We don’t have to make everything about ourselves. I am an enthusiast, and being cynical when everyone else is cheering is territory as unknown to me as the moon. If I don’t like Gerwig’s Little Women, who even am I for heaven’s sake? As I left the cinema, I was reminded of a time when a bunch of friends fixed me up with someone they knew I’d love. He was a book editor! And Jewish! But I rejected him, and they despaired – what more could I want? Sometimes ideas you love in theory crash on the rocks of reality. And sometimes they’re just overfamiliar. The trailers before Little Women were for the upcoming films of Emma and The Secret Garden. But there are many other great books about women – Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Zadie Smith’s On Beauty – that are less cosy, less white and have not been turned into a film a thousand times before. As the March sisters say, when bemoaning their poverty in the book: no one likes to see the same old dresses again and again. I didn’t marry the Jewish book editor – instead, I went off and had a fling with someone who was neither of those things. Similarly, I didn’t love Little Women, but instead fell for the next film I saw, Uncut Gems, an Adam Sandler thriller, of all unlikely genres. We don’t always want the dishy young French guy. Sometimes we surprise ourselves and prefer the ugly old German.
