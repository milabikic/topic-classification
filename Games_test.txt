Police in the western Indian state of Gujarat detained 10 teenagers for breaking a newly announced ban on playing the online video game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds (PUBG) – the forerunner of global smash Fortnite. The ban was announced last week by local authorities to combat what they called the spread of “violent traits” in kids playing the game. The detained teenagers were taken into custody but later released with a warning, said Manoj Agrawal, police commissioner of Rajkot city in Gujarat on Thursday. “Due to these games, the education of children and youth are being affected and it affects the behaviour, manners, speech and development of the youth and children,” an order by local police dated 6 March said. Police in Gujarat have not banned Fortnite, a popular rival to PUBG developed by US-based Epic Games. PUBG, made by South Korean firm Bluehole Inc, is a survival-themed battle game that drops dozens of online players on an island to try to eliminate each other. Asked in a public debate in January about the negative effects of video games on kids, the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi said: “Was he playing PUBG? Like everything else, technology too comes with its positives and negatives. “As parents, we must guide our children to get the most from technology. We should encourage their curiosity to learn new things.” Fortnite and PUBG, each backed by Chinese internet company Tencent, are credited with helping take video games to new audiences. Bluehole and Epic Games did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
In the century and a bit since its founding in 1889, Nintendo has made playing cards, designed toys, hired out taxis and briefly run love hotels, but it is the last 40 years or so that have made it a cultural icon. Having dabbled in the video games business throughout the 1970s, in the 1980s Nintendo released the Game & Watch and the Nintendo Entertainment System, and since then it has introduced hundreds of millions of people to the joy of video games – from 90s kids squinting at monochrome Game Boys to grandmothers bowling on the Wii. Nintendo’s hallmarks are innovation and an unwavering focus on fun. Where other big players in the games industry have chased the latest technology and positioned their consoles as entertainment hubs, Nintendo has mostly come out with affordable, family-friendly machines that combine technical innovations such as the Wii’s motion control or the DS’s touchscreen with fun, accessible games in the vein of Mario, Zelda, Pokémon and Wii Sports. Nintendo hasn’t always been at the top of the sales charts, but no other video game creator has proven so enduringly popular across generations. A lot has changed since 1985, but kids still know who Mario is. The company is based in Kyoto, Kansai, a region of Japan known for its sense of humour. All art is a product of culture, and it’s not difficult to see elements of Kansai culture in Nintendo’s fun-centric philosophy. “In Kansai, we make much of laughter,” says Shinya Takahashi, a 20-year Nintendo veteran who currently oversees the Nintendo Switch. “I hope that we can bring laughter to others through our games. “We are now living in the age of the internet and social media, so whenever we release a new game or console, we can get a read on people’s reactions immediately – but in the past we could not,” he reminisces. “What we used to do was look at people’s faces while they are playing. When I was younger, when the games I was involved with were eventually released, I would go to some of the toy stores and sneak a look at people’s faces while they played. If people looked surprised or happy, if they laughed, I’d think: yes, we did it!” Nintendo is currently at a high point in its fortunes. Its latest console, the Switch, was released in March 2017 and is selling very well, after its 2012 predecessor, the Wii U, failed to find an audience and sent stock prices tumbling. It has been a relief for the company’s senior executives, not least Takahashi. “Before the Switch came out, it was very difficult to explain something unprecedented - a game console that you can play in your house and also carry around with you to play anywhere,” he says. “But after people started experiencing that, they started talking among themselves. That was when the Switch was flipped, so to speak.” “It never gets any easier,” laughs Hisashi Nogami, who has lived through several risky Nintendo launches since he joined the company in 1994, from the endearingly toy-like GameCube to the awkward-looking original Nintendo DS. “With anything new it’s the unknown, and people don’t like trying unknown things – they’re always going to be a bit hesitant.” Takahashi recalls the moment when the prototype for a motion-controlled console that let people play games by waving a remote– the Wii – was first shown to Nintendo’s wider development team. “Even among our developers there are often doubts! When the Wii remote was first introduced as a concept, the reaction was: what is that? Is it real? Will it actually work? But once we’d all tried it, we were surprised and delighted by it, and that made us realise that it was going to work out. With the Nintendo Switch, we all knew the concept, but when we picked up the prototype for the first time and saw Mario Kart running perfectly on the smaller screen, we were flabbergasted. Even people who are well aware of the concept and design can’t always tell if something’s going to work.” “It’s not good enough to put your idea into words; you have to give people a concrete example to show them how it works,” agrees Nogami. “It’s on us to create things that allow players to experience that ‘wow’ moment.” Gaming has only recently become a cross-generational activity. People who grew up with video games in the 1980s and 90s now have families of their own, and smartphones have opened up video games to almost everyone. The most recent Pokémon game, Let’s Go Pikachu/Eevee, was designed with this fact in mind. It packs a powerful nostalgia punch for the Pokémon kids of the 90s, but is also accessible enough for today’s kids, and borrows some ideas from the wildly popular smartphone game Pokémon Go. In the same way that Nintendo games have now been enjoyed by generations of players, they are made by different generations of developers: Junichi Masuda, one of Pokémon’s original creators, now works alongside 30-year-old developers who once traded Pokémon cards in the playground. Takahashi says that he has often been approached by newer Nintendo employees who enjoyed the games he worked on 10 or 15 years ago. “Not every younger employee is like, sir, I want to follow in your footsteps, please tell me what I should do – that’s never the case!” laughs Takahashi. “Right now, because people of different generations are now working together, they’re always coming up with different ideas about how best to provide a meaningful surprise to players. And I think our job is combining these different ideas to create brand new ways of entertaining people. If we notice that only the senior male employees are gathering together to discuss an idea, one of us will say: we need to get some different perspectives on this.” “It’s not just about which generation they’ve grown up in, but what they’ve grown up with, where they come from, what are their interests,” adds Nogami. “The ideas that people come up with would be different if they’re really into sports, or loved reading books all the time. Somebody who’s grown up playing video games all their life will have different ideas to someone who has grown up with social media. What’s really great about working at Nintendo is that you have all these people from different generations and backgrounds sharing ideas.” Currently, the average age of a Nintendo employee in Japan is 38 years, and the average length of service is 13.5 years. Unusually for a video game company (though not, perhaps, so unusually for a Japanese company), Nintendo appears to be good at retaining its talent. Many of the designers behind some of its earliest successes – including Shigeru Miyamoto, creator of both Mario and Zelda – are still around. Takahashi and Nogami joke that Miyamoto has become something of a mythical figure at Nintendo: listening to them, one imagines the revered designer popping up out of nowhere to pass judgement on game projects in progress. “He is not involved in the minute details of development, but does oversee entire projects and identifies major issues: this part is bad, this part is bad, THIS part is bad … ” laughs Takahashi. “If he says something’s good, it’s rare, and you know it is. He’s actually a shy person – even when he thinks something is well done, he would not often say that to someone directly.” “I have never once been praised by Mr Miyamoto,” Nogami chimes in, deadpan. “Perhaps not to your face, but behind your back he’s very pleased with you,” Takahashi laughs. It is new generations of talent, rather than the old hands, that are now driving Nintendo’s fortunes. At the V&A’s recent Videogames: Design/Play/Disrupt exhibition, the Nintendo game on display wasn’t Donkey Kong, Super Mario World, or some other relic of the game-maker’s distant past; it was Splatoon, a vivacious, colourful, family-friendly shooter made by one of Nintendo’s youngest teams and produced by Hisashi Nogami. It is one of Nintendo’s most successful games in years. “Some things have changed, others haven’t,” says Nogami, reflecting on his time with Nintendo. “For me, games are still a place where you can have fun. But the gaming generation has extended: it used to be just children, but now it’s a whole huge swathe of people. Seeing lots of generations playing and enjoying themselves, that’s the biggest thing that has changed for me … I don’t think that the general player knows just how much work goes into making a game, but then I also don’t think they necessarily need to know.” “Thirty years ago, if we asked the question, ‘Do you play games?’, the answer might have been yes or no,” adds Takahashi. “Now, if we ask the same question, the great majority of people are going to say yes … We are trying to entertain [all] those people. Like a swan, we look elegant above the surface. But underneath the water, we might be paddling like crazy.”
So you’re 16 and at a schoolfriend’s party. You’ve had three or four drinks already, and are just starting to feel it. The most popular guy in the class comes up and demands you have another. And then another. What happens next? Rather than finding out in real life, researchers in Denmark, who are trying to cure Europe’s worst teenage binge-drinking problem, hope the likely consequences can be shown virtually in a game due to launch later this year. “Virtual reality can provide a really intense experience, the feeling of actually being there, but without the real-life harm of getting drunk and blacking out,” said Gunver Majgaard, a robotics and learning specialist at Southern Denmark University. “You can tell teenagers two beers is enough: they know the facts. But facts are not the same as experience. We hope that presenting them with a simulated situation, where they have to make decisions about alcohol, will help them cope better with real parties.” Danish 15- to 17-year-olds are the heaviest drinkers for their age in Europe. The latest 35-country Espad [European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs] report on alcohol and drug use by schoolchildren found 73% had had alcohol in the previous month, compared with 48% across the EU, while nearly one in three had been drunk during the same period – three times the European average. “There’s been a very slight improvement recently,” said Peter Dalum, head of a national youth alcohol campaign run jointly by the Danish Cancer Society and TrygFonden public health foundation. “But as a teen in Denmark, you’re basically considered strange if you don’t drink alcohol. And getting it is very easy.” The game, played on a mobile phone using a simple cardboard VR headset, aims to give teenagers a “unique tool to investigate the social mechanisms surrounding parties and drinking,” said Majgaard, whose team have just finished filming 125 videos using a 360-degree camera and are editing them into a VR package. Set at a teenager’s home before a party, and at the party itself, with 35 real pupils as the guests, it gives players options including accepting a beer (and another, and another) or resisting peer pressure by heading for the dance floor, getting food, going to the toilet or chatting to a friend. With every drink, your virtual blood-alcohol level – displayed on the screen – rises, and the game’s universe becomes more blurred. “So we have a realistic scenario, where eventually people will start to fall over chairs, or end up being sick,” Majgaard said. “It lasts up to 15 minutes – shorter if you drink too much, because you black out, and longer if you go back and make different choices.” Dalum said the £240,000 project, which will be trialled and assessed in schools before being uploaded to app stores later this year, could help because “by making risks realistic, you also make them relevant. Often with prevention, the difficulty is in making people see a relevance to them. This project achieves that.” Moderate-strength alcoholic drinks, such as beer, can be bought legally by 16-year-olds in Denmark from supermarkets, convenience stores and kiosks. “Beer even gets served at school parties – on school premises – to 15-year-olds,” said Dalum. “That sends a very strong signal.” A 2017 World Health Organisation alcohol accessibility report showed that Sweden, Norway and Finland –where strictly controlled, government-owned off-licences are the only retail outlets allowed to sell alcohol stronger than 3.5% by volume – have less of a problem than Denmark. Dalum is calling for a minimum age of 18 for consumption, a higher minimum price per unit, a nationwide programme of local authority and parental action and a ban on the sale of alcohol in schools. “But the politicians aren’t interested,” he said. “In fact they’ve just reduced the duty on alcohol – not by much, but again it sends a signal. They say it should be up to parents; we can’t be a nanny state; other problems are more important. Generally, the idea is that you can’t do much about this, it’s not a huge problem anyway, yet concerted action really can make a big difference: over the course of several years, Iceland has managed to cut alcohol, tobacco and marijuana use by young people massively, to single [percentage] figures.”
Despite appearances, this frenetic, over-the-top action game about sexy demon hunters isn’t just another power fantasy. Instead, as you hack your way through the hellish hordes and survive intense battles with single foes of unparalleled ferocity, you’ll realise it’s all about self-improvement, about rising to meet the high-octane challenges before you, and doing it in style. Devil May Cry 5 has the confidence to give you tools, show you your foes, and say: if you think you can do this, then step up and prove it. The combat itself is a spectacle. It looks chaotically hack-and-slash at first glance, but you’ll soon find that to truly be SSStylish, you’ll need to master efficiency, variety, and precision. Reading enemy movements or trapping them in unending combos is of paramount importance, with defensive options relatively strict in their timing; you can’t get by just wildly hammering attacks and trusting your reactions (though there are difficulty-mediating options for first timers). At first it looks like DMC5 – which resurrects an action series that’s been dormant for over a decade – might be a bit too self-referential for newcomers, though in truth “there’s a big demon tree and you need to kill it” is all the plot you really need to know. It’s a fun, pulpy romp, aided by quippy writing, sharp action-movie direction and surprisingly emotive character work courtesy of Capcom’s RE Engine. For those who do remember them, though, the story is packed with callbacks to the older Devil May Cry games (the 2013 DmC reboot is politely ignored, though stylistic influences remain). You might start out feeling overwhelmed, but the difficulty curve is such that it isn’t long before you’re dancing between demons in a single free-flowing combo, bullets flying, sword periodically bursting into flames. Given the dizzying complexity of possible inputs – iconic protagonist Dante can swap guns, melee weapons and combat styles on the fly – it’s astounding how good the game is at training you to play it. Even new character V, who uses summoned beasts in a genre defined by direct, immediate control of your fighter, feels surprisingly agile, fluid, and fun to use. Earlier Devil May Cry games tended towards the cartoonish, but here every enemy is a grotesquely detailed monstrosity, every attack a flurry of glowing, dazzling particles. It all looks extremely pretty, but can also hurt combat readability, especially when you’re trying to come to grips with new foes. A similar issue arises with the level design: every environment, whether grey crumbling ruin or fleshy body-horror landscape, looks so immaculate that it’s occasionally difficult to tell which parts are purely aesthetic and which you can interact with. Beyond the fighting, some of DMC5’s peripheral elements feel bolted on. There’s a multiplayer cameo feature where other players’ fights play out in the background, which is cool but inconsequential, a bare-bones training room, and a gacha-esque shop where you can spend real money on in-game cash (though thankfully you probably won’t really need to). But the core of the game – the style and the substance – is rock-solid. DMC5 is a lot like Dante himself: older, grizzled, more experienced, yet still unapologetically juvenile in the best possible way. It’s bloody, spectacular and irresistible, all cheesy one-liners, guns, swords and explosions while guitars scream in the background, and it plays like a dream. Director Hideaki Itsuno and his team have delivered: Devil May Cry is back. Devil May Cry 5 is out 8 March; £39.99.
Who knows what could possibly be driving this, but post-apocalyptic video games are having a moment. In the past year we’ve already seen Fallout 76, Anthem and Metro Exodus, while an open beta for Ubisoft’s online shooter The Division 2, set in a ruined Washington DC, started on 1 March. Arguably, however, the two most anticipated genre pieces are still to come on PlayStation 4: Days Gone and The Last of Us 2. Both set after most of the population has been wiped out by a pandemic, their different approaches tell us a lot about what it takes to stand out from the shambling, undead crowd. Days Gone, out April 26 from Sony Bend Studios, takes an open-world approach. Set after a virus has turned most of humanity (and a lot of animals) into bloodthirsty monsters, you play as roving bounty hunter and motorcycle fanatic Deacon St John. Cruising around Oregon’s High Desert region with his best friend Boozer, he gets into confrontations with the infected – called freakers – as well as the low-life thieves and bandits who prosper amid the anarchy. The world is a vast space, featuring dense woodlands, sparse mountainous regions, small towns and deserted compounds, all freely explorable. What you do in this savage world will be familiar to anyone who’s played anything with the words Far Cry in the title over the past five years. There’s an overarching narrative involving a sinister government agency known as Nero (a sort of hyper-weaponised Fema), and also a personal backstory centred on Deacon’s wife, Sarah, for whom he appears to be grieving. Side-stores and characters can be discovered around the various friendly encampments dotted about the place, and outside of that you can busy yourself raiding bandit camps (like the camps in Far Cry) or destroying freaker nests, which opens up fast travel points (like, er, the camps in Far Cry). What’s new of course is the concept of hordes – vast groups of zombies, sometimes numbering in the hundreds, that migrate across the landscape. Battling these is a major undertaking, with players needing to assess the local terrain, using traps, explosives, pinch points and lots of ammo to cope as the sprinting monsters swarm to get at you. Players who love to stake out a survival scenario, intricately planning offensives and taking their time over preparations, are going to really enjoy dealing with these gigantic death gangs. Sound triggers local freakers – and wildlife – to investigate the player. I got into a major shoot-out at a bandit camp on a mountain ridge and within seconds, hordes of freakers descended on us, helpfully taking out several enemies – but then I was attacked by a pack of wolves also drawn to the scene. A day/night cycle and changing weather also work together to vary conditions and risks immensely – zombies are stronger in the dark, but rain dampens their senses, so your plans have to take the environment into account. There are some big questions that Sony Bend will have to wrestle with. Days Gone has all the ingredients of a decent, involving open-world shooter; there looks to be masses of freedom to approach things the way you want. But everything – from the mission structure to the Pacific Northwestern landscapes to the damaged male protagonist – looks and feels extremely familiar. When Sony started rolling out trailers featuring a flashback to Deacon and Sarah’s wedding, then present day scenes of him standing alone with a photo of the wedding, looking vengeful, the internet collectively rolled its eyes: the dialogue on Twitter was: “Great, another story where a man’s emotional depth comes from the death of a woman”. This grieve-and-avenge trope has become a cliche in the action movie and action game genres, as has world-weary bros bonding over a dying world: Days Gone doesn’t just remind me of Far Cry, but also Red Dead Redemption 2. (Deacon’s motorbike, is, let’s face it, a substitute horse.) 2013’s The Last of Us originally looked like another entry in this genre playbook, with protagonist Joel losing his daughter then developing a paternal relationship with feisty teen Ellie. But in choosing a linear, narrative-over-freedom approach, developer Naughty Dog crafted a much more focused, complex story, in which Ellie has agency (and, you know, she’s alive), and where the power dynamics constantly shifted between the two characters. From what we’ve seen so far, the sequel, The Last of Us 2 (also likely to come out this year), takes a similar approach, centring its post-apocalypse on people rather than dramatic events. The latest trailer focused largely on a romantic relationship between Ellie and a new girlfriend, Dina. These seem to be the ways to tell a post-apocalyptic video game story in 2019 – make us think about how the world works, how natural and manmade systems interact, or make us think about individuals caught in the maelstrom, trying to live their lives. We see this dichotomy throughout post-apocalyptic fiction: on one side, the big set-piece global thrillers such as World War Z and 28 Weeks Later and on the other, quiet, intimate tragic tales such as The Road and the recent Netflix movie Cargo. What we’ve yet to see – and what The Last of Us 2 will hopefully provide – is a post-apocalyptic game that really challenges the gender dynamics of the genre. One day it would be fascinating to play a post-apocalyptic adventure where the pandemic kills all the cynical tough guys first – but we’re likely to be kept waiting a long time for that.
Half a decade since the release of Dead or Alive 5, the sixth instalment of this well-known fighting game arrives in a world that has moved on in some respects. Recent times have been good for fighting game fans, thanks to games such as Injustice and Mortal Kombat, along with Dragonball FighterZ and Super Smash Bros Ultimate. So Dead or Alive 6 doesn’t lack competition. But developer Team Ninja has 22 years’ experience in fighting games and that shines through. It looks fabulous – it might be the most graphically impressive beat-’em-up ever. Its gameplay can’t be faulted: the franchise’s trademark triangle system – in which holds counter strikes, which in turn counter throws – generates absorbing, tactical bouts. Its balance of characters is effective: between them, they represent just about every fighting style, from WWE-style wrestling to Jeet Kune Do, plus some that should be invented, such as Brad Wong’s tipsy headstands in his drunken master method. Dead or Alive 6 is great to play and to behold, but it has an inescapable aesthetic that feels out of touch with the prevailing mood. Team Ninja has always specialised in the super-accurate modelling and animation of human bodies, but has been criticised for its fixation on breast modelling. This was taken to the extreme in its Dead or Alive Xtreme Beach Volleyball games, where the female fighters appear in bikinis. True to form, Dead or Alive 6 features a number of unfeasibly flawless female characters with meticulously modelled busts that are out of proportion with the rest of their bodies. Add a set of costumes that starts with kawaii schoolgirl outfits before moving into fetish party territory and it’s no surprise that accusations of sexism are being hurled at Dead or Alive 6. In combination with some of the hyper-masculinised (though less sexualised) male characters’ rippled torsos, the game has a whiff of 70s soft porn about it. It’s a shame, because Dead or Alive 6 feels great to play. It even has an impressively innovative story mode, delivered in tiny bite-sized chunks that assemble into non-linear chapters, which lets you follow the storyline of groups of fighters. Admittedly, the story itself is frothier than a cappuccino, following the operatives of rival organisations DOATEC and MIST as they assemble for the sixth Dead or Alive tournament, but it is freshly presented and entertaining. The enjoyable quest mode rewards you with unlocks and background info for playing as and against all the foes in the game. You can, of course, set up custom bouts and play against your friends locally or online. And Team Ninja has successfully tweaked the fighting system, adding a break gauge that allows you to launch a devastating attack or an unstoppable parry strike. While the characters do have their own special moves, they are much simpler and easier to trigger than in rival beat-’em-ups, with each character’s standard special move mapped to the right bumper. Those who have enjoyed Dead or Alive games in the past will love Dead or Alive 6 – it looks and feels like it always did, but with state-of-the-art graphics and engine technology. Unfortunately, the fact that it has also preserved the tone of its predecessors will limit its appeal. Dead or Alive 6 is out now; £49.99.
Charlie Brooker’s Black Mirror special Bandersnatch is Netflix’s first dive into interactive storytelling. Its success will inevitably pave the way for more ambitious creators, would-be auteurs and flagrant imitators who, just like Bandersnatch’s protagonist Stefan, are eager to explore what can happen when the outcome of their stories is decided by the viewer. Of course, video games have been playing with the power of narrative decision-making since the 1980s. There’s now a huge catalogue of interactive stories spanning genres from anime-romance to horror, crime thriller to supernatural chiller. Here are five of the best. The Walking Dead Available on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS This interactive spin-off of the hit TV show has you regularly wrestling with your morality as you guide a young girl named Clementine and her companions along a post-apocalyptic journey that showcases the necessity of selfishness when it comes to survival. The game’s shining moments come in how it handles group dynamics. There’s no pleasing everyone and often in The Walking Dead, saving one life will make you complicit in the death of somebody else. Friends can become enemies at the touch of a button and leave you regretting choices you made just moments earlier. If zombies aren’t your thing, check out the sadly defunct developer Telltale Games’ other releases such as Batman, Game of Thrones and Minecraft. The Wolf Among Us is especially good, a fantastic adaptation of the Fables comics, which throw fairytale characters into a seedy Manhattan community. Her Story Available on: iOS, Microsoft Windows, Android An interactive crime drama, Her Story boasts a level of narrative detail and complexity that is simply astounding. You play the role of a detective at your computer, watching interview footage of a suspect in order to solve the disappearance of a man named Simon. It’s Simon’s wife, Hannah, who is the main suspect being interviewed. You must pay careful attention to her words and behaviour, typing in new keywords to find further evidence. Her Story is unlike any other video game out there, and definitely worth the time of any interactive movie fan or detective thriller. Life Is Strange Available on: PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Android, iOS Max Caulfield is a talented young photographer studying at Blackwell Academy, a high school hiding a dark secret. After discovering she has the power to rewind time, she finds that the smallest decisions can dramatically change the future. Its high school setting provides the perfect canvas for an angsty teenage adventure that sensitively handles many of the themes associated with coming-of-age tales – family feuds and friendship in particular. Often, the choices you make in the game are dictated by the way you respond during conversation. In one scenario, you find yourself on a rooftop with a suicidal classmate, trying to talk her down. Life Is Strange is a slow burner, with some awkward writing in the first couple of episodes, but once it gets going, it’s an emotional rollercoaster that may have you close to tears. A good one to play with friends or family, as you agonise over decisions and share poignant moments. Until Dawn Available on: PlayStation 4 Eight teenagers visit a spooky lodge, out in the middle of nowhere, on the anniversary of their friend going missing – what could possibly go wrong? This schlocky, intentionally cliched horror game is an adrenaline-fuelled experience where your decisions will either save the game’s protagonists or see them killed. The number of outcomes on offer makes Until Dawn particularly fun to revisit until you find a way to save everyone – first time through, your decision-making is often fuelled by impulse decisions during terrifying chase scenes. Like its slasher movie counterparts, Until Dawn suffers from a muddy plot structure, but that isn’t enough to detract from the frantic pace and intriguing mystery. Equal praise needs to be given to its disgustingly dissonant soundtrack, scored by Jason Graves. Detroit: Become Human Available on: PlayStation 4 “I did not murder him!” It’s difficult not to draw comparisons between the characters and aesthetic of I, Robot and Detroit, and while they both explore stories of sentient androids, Detroit’s story is told from the perspective of these androids: courageous police investigator Connor, defiant former companion Markus and housekeeper Kara, all beginning to question their relationship with humans. Your decisions in the game tackle difficult themes, and it’s not hard to become emotionally invested in any of its three characters as you guide them towards their freedom – or not. Detroit lays bare the effects of your decisions in giant flow-charts that show just how much variation there is in the story.
People love to take pictures in video games. As the game worlds we explore have become more beautiful, players have become more interested in photographing them and sharing the results. It is almost standard for open-world games in particular to include photo modes, which allow players to mimic real-world photographers by adjusting the framing, brightness and exposure. Selfie modes, meanwhile, let you add filters and change characters’ facial expressions, from Link in The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker to Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2. There is even an augmented-reality photo mode in Pokémon Go, which lets players take posed photos of digital Pokémon in the real world. Some games take it a step further, incorporating photography as an interaction within the game. One of the earliest examples is Gekibo: Gekisha Boy, a 1992 Japanese game that almost made it to Europe a decade later as Polaroid Pete, before its release was cancelled. It plays like a side-scrolling shooter but with a camera for a gun. The cartoonish subjects users can photograph include extraterrestrials, racist caricatures and women in various states of undress. More recently, Grand Theft Auto V (2013) features side missions in which Franklin is asked, among other things, to film an actor having sex in a garden. Paparazzi!: Tales of Tinseltown (1995) is a full-motion video game about capturing celebrities in compromising situations. In a more family friendly take, Super Mario Party (2018) includes a mini-game called Slaparazzi, in which players vie for prime position in a photo. You can photograph animals in their natural (digital) habitats in Wild Earth (2006), Endless Ocean (2007), and Afrika (2008). Wild Earth was turned into an award-winning motion simulator ride at Philadelphia Zoo. In Dinosaur Safari (1996), players travelled back in time to photograph dinosaurs for the “National Chronographic”. If you want to capture better-looking dinosaurs, you can take on photography missions in the park simulation game Jurassic World Evolution (2018). For animal photography on the go, Snapimals: Discover Animals (2015) is free to play on Android and iOS. But the most famous example of pretend nature photography is the Nintendo 64 game Pokémon Snap (1999), in which Professor Oak entreats the player to photograph Pokémon on a safari, using unlockable items to coax them into poses such as Pikachu riding on an Electrode. Players could even head to Blockbuster to get their photos printed, a charmingly retro feature that is similar to one offered in 2016 by Campo Santo, which let people order prints of the photos they took in its game Firewatch. Games often use photography as a method of collection, from Donkey Kong 64’s Banana Fairies (1999) to Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s: captured memories (2017). In Metal Gear Solid (1998), players could even use a camera to reveal Easter eggs – “ghosts” of the game’s developers. In the grand tradition of video games turning work into play, many games use photography as a school or job assignment. Bully (2006), Rockstar’s foray into school simulation, featured photography classes. Life Is Strange (2015) protagonist Max Caulfield is a photography student with the ability to rewind time. In Aardman Animations and Digixart’s 11-11: Memories Retold (2018), photography is compulsory and central to the plot, as part of an exploration of propaganda. In a first world war setting painted in the style of the French impressionists, players switch between a German engineer and a Canadian photographer who is armed with the most portable version of an era-appropriate camera the team could find. The photos were made black and white, for historical realism and to distinguish them from screenshots. “We wanted to make a war game that was not about killing people,” says producer Lionel Lovisa, who also worked on a psychological thriller called Get Even (2017) that featured a souped-up smartphone whose camera doubled as an analysis tool. Lovisa admires games in which photography is more than pretty pictures, such as the Fatal Frame series, in which you use a camera to capture ghosts. “When you have the camera you cannot move as much, which kind of increases the scariness.” In a forthcoming game called The Bradwell Conspiracy, photography replaces conversation. The player character is trapped in a collapsing museum, and to escape must work with a person called Amber, trapped elsewhere, by sending photos of their surroundings. This photography feature was originally complementary, but worked so well in user testing that it entirely replaced dialogue. Amber speaks, but the protagonist is silent. “Just look at how people use Snapchat and Instagram,” says its creative director Georg Backer. “Everybody uses photos these days, to communicate anything. Even my mum.” But where The Bradwell Conspiracy is using photography for co-operation, another forthcoming game turns it into a competition. Snap Hunt will challenge four players to compete to get the best photos of a fifth, who controls a cryptid. “I almost imagine a celebrity,” says producer Christian Stochholm, “trying to avoid all these paparazzi.” Stochholm was inspired by Fatal Frame and Pokémon Snap. “I wasn’t into violent games when I was younger,” he says. “Pokémon Snap kind of filled that hole. It’s like you’re playing a rail shooter, but at the same time you’re taking photos.” The camera is a convenient nonviolent replacement for a gun, a principle perhaps taken most literally by Shoot the Bullet (2005), a bullet hell game in which you clear bullets by photographing them. Considering the growing fatigue many players have with killing things in video games and the tempting prospect of instant sharing and social media virality, perhaps more developers will use photography to let players interact with game worlds, and with other players. And thanks to the ubiquity of smartphone photography, everyone knows how to point and shoot.
A group of people drop on to a large island. For the next 20 minutes they must search buildings for useful weapons and equipment, before fighting to the death. As the match progresses, the playable area contracts, forcing the competitors closer together. The last person standing wins. This is of course battle royale, a new type of online shooting game currently being enjoyed by over 200 million people across the globe. The current craze started with Day Z: Battle Royale, a modification of the zombie survival game DayZ developed by lone designer Brendan Greene, later updated as PlayerUnknown’s Battle Royale. Its popularity caught the attention of Korean developer Bluehole, who employed Greene to oversee development of a full game. PUBG was launched as a beta in early 2017 and by December, it had 30 million players. Noticing this success, Epic Games released a free battle royale version of its online co-op game Fortnite, offering a cartoony visual style and a Minecraft-style construction element. That was September 2017. The following year, the game earned $2.4bn from players’ purchases. Last October, Activision added a battle royale mode named Blackout to Call of Duty: Black Ops 4, and on 4 February, Respawn Entertainment launched Apex: Legends. Within a week, it had gathered 10 million players, rocket-boosting publisher Electronic Arts’ share value. Even though the visual styles and narrative settings of these games are very different, the four giants of the genre adhere to a strict set of conventions. The islands are scattered with towns, villages, and industrial complexes, they all have rivers and bridges and offshore isles and they’re all roughly the same shape. But what makes them so compelling? Why is a generation of kids is probably more comfortable navigating from Tilted Towers to Paradise Palms than they are from home to the shops? Dave Curd is the world art director on PUBG. He’s been designing first-person shooter maps for years, and the first thing he says about the layout of battle royale landscapes is that there’s never anything accidental about the way that towns and other scenic features are dispersed. Everything is driven by a combination of design and technical considerations. “If you put cities too close together, players aren’t incentivised to leave, but put them too far apart and players get bored of the journey in between,” he says. “Also, you don’t want five or six cities crowded together or you can run into too many assets loading at once.” “There’s a sweet spot where it’s fun and performs well for everybody, and we get there by lots of playtests and lots of analysing data in the field,” he explains. “Every map, you’ll notice the art gets a little better and the assets are a little more dispersed – we’re always learning.” David Vonderhaar is the studio design director at Treyarch, the veteran Call of Duty developer behind the new Blackout mode. When his team set out to create a battle royale map, they initially tried to bring in their experience from traditional first-person shooters, but that proved to be a mistake. “Many of those map guidelines that worked for multiplayer needed to be rewritten or removed,” he says. “Certain things like the definition of a structure, the entrance/exit requirements need to be modified and updated … We had to spend a lot of time in early development carefully describing the variety and locations of destinations on the map, and how they related to one another.” Battle royale maps provide a lot of liminal spaces between intense combat zones, and managing how players transition around the map – especially how they enter and exit important areas – is vital. “We wanted variety, so that assaulting or fleeing [an area] is special,” says Vonderhaar. “Topography helped achieve that. Sometimes destinations are uphill (Asylum), in the middle of a dense forest (The Hind Clearing), or require crossing flat, exposed terrain (Cargo).” In a game type where players create their own stories, arriving at a location – or evacuating it at speed – are important elements. Some scenic elements crop up again and again, because they’re useful for creating specific player experiences, which is generally difficult in a vast open space. “One of the big challenges of designing a battle royale map is that players can approach from any direction, including landing right in the middle of it,” says Curd. “So we use areas like small islands and long bridges to create bottlenecks and chokepoints, and to intentionally encourage certain types of gameplay. In those small areas, we have a very good idea how people will interact. It’s kind of fun for players to camp a bridge, to feel smart, to feel like highwaymen.” Another vital design element is the use of tall architectural structures such as masts and towers. Partly this is about adding verticality to the play space, which was the impetus behind Blackout’s towering construction site area, with its uncompleted skyscraper. However, it’s also about helping players to figure out where they are. “These maps are really 90% nature and 10% manmade architecture, so the latter has to stand out, it has to break the horizon line,” says Curd. “The use of vertical architecture as navigation points is pivotal – we need to landmark so that players inherently understand where they are in relation to each other. You have to see it from 2km to know where you’re going. Tall or unique structures act as very natural markers. It means players don’t have to keep yelling, ‘He’s over there in the trees.’” What is fascinating is how the designers of battle royale maps use subtle environmental bait to get players moving and exploring. “We use clumps of cover as little areas of safety to tempt the players,” says Curd. “Whether that’s your typical crate or barrel pile, an old flipped over truck, a long wall or a small shack, you’d be surprised how much you can influence the player with both smart loot placement and cover placement at sprintable distances. Players can do that risk-reward calculation of, ‘OK, I’m going to be exposed for a few seconds, but then I’m going to have access to five new buildings, and buildings are the prize because they have loot, but more importantly they have windows I can sight from.’” Vondehaar concurs: “We never want the player to feel like they aren’t making progress moving across the map because there isn’t anything to get to. If you were to take a ruler a measure between any two destinations in Blackout, you’d see what we think is our sweet spot.” Environmental storytelling is also important to holding players’ interest. Epic Games has excelled at this with Fortnite, creating its own mythology via falling meteors, mysterious hatches, intriguing posters and TV screens showing images that hint at new game features. The landscape is constantly evolving and players love to speculate on what it all means. In a more subtle way, battle royale games rely on scenic features to hint at a sense of history. “We use low-level stuff, like adding wear and tear to objects, to suggest these places are abandoned or that the occupants left in a hurry,” says Curd. “We can also be more overt – in the Sanhok map there are training-ground locations where you’ll find hints that this might be a training facility for actual battle royale combatants. We don’t want to hit the player over the head with story, but we’re leaving clues to gently breadcrumb them along.” All the successful battle royale titles know the importance of subtlety. Whether you’re exploring the crypts of Haunted Hills or the metallic corridors of the Hydro Dam in Apex Legends, you won’t find complex multi-level floor layouts, and you won’t find masses of furniture – all the buildings are rather square and the rooms rather empty. Partly this is to ensure players can quickly spot useful items amid purely decorative objects, but it is also about gameplay. “You want relatively simple interiors so that players can use hearing effectively,” says Curd. “They need to be able to know the other player is upstairs, they’re below, they’re just outside – if we made our structures too complex, it would be really difficult to play the game. Sound is such a big deal and our simple approach to interior design reflects that.” As with any “live” game that’s played by thousands or millions at a time, iteration drives the design process. “We playtest rigorously,’” says Curd. “It’s literally like designing an enormous first-person shooter map. We have the same principles of design: fun drives decisions. If we try something, no matter how cool it looks, no matter what we thought we wanted, if the playtests don’t prove it out, it gets the boot.” Iterating on the studio’s own ideas is only part of the process – a successful battle royale developer also needs to understand the variety of needs from potential players. An important element of this process is categorising them – run’n’gun fanatics, explorers, snipers – then making sure there are areas for all of them. “When you have a game that reaches as many as ours does you have to realise that they’re not all going to be your typical FPS high-conflict gamer, especially in our Asian markets,” says Curd. “We have a sizeable number of players who enjoy the survival aspect: looting, hiding, sneaking. Some players don’t even go for guns – they enjoy the tactics of hiding and outsmarting other players, and getting to the next circle. “I am an SMG and shotgun player, so I’m always going to make sure there is something for people who like to get into close-quarters combat. But we know we have a hell of a lot of expert snipers, so we want areas with less foliage, stark terrain, so you can really see those figures against that blistering orange sun. If you go to a town and there’s a large apartment building with lots of windows, we want players to feel that stress of, ‘Is anyone watching me?’” Curd traces the lineage of this design approach to an unexpected source. “With Dark Souls, people were excited about how it was difficult and opaque,” he says. “It proved there was an appetite for opacity in design, for not doling information out to players so directly. The battle royale genre has proven that players can tolerate really high-stress situations, really opaque choices, and not always knowing the clearest way to play.” Studios use maps not just as interesting combinations of rural and urban locations, but for storytelling, as props to the narratives that players create as they play. Buildings are there to hide items but they’re also navigational tools; bridges provide access but also choke points to encourage shootouts. Players aren’t told any of this – they have to learn how to read and understand a battle royale environment, like a rambler picking up subtle clues from the local vegetation, from the flow of a stream, or the direction of a hedgerow. The worlds are open and free to roam through – nothing is directed. And the unpredictable interactions between these systems of freedom and direction are as much fun to watch as they are to play: a valuable asset in this era of Twitch streamers and YouTube superstars. “Whenever you ask someone about their first victory, I guarantee you they have a little story about how they got there,” says Curd. “These games are high stakes, high danger, high challenge, and that’s super satisfying … We want to be tested. We want to be pushed.”
Last year, Mario died. The real Mario – the man after whom the character was named. Mario Segale was a real estate developer who rented space to Nintendo of America, headquartered in Seattle. The story goes that one day, a team at Nintendo was trying to figure out names for characters in Donkey Kong – including a certain small man wearing a red hat. As fate would have it, Segale walked into the room and into video game history. The mustachioed carpenter (he was only later employed as a plumber) got his name, and he has been stomping Goombas and racing go-karts ever since. While the character has acquired countless extra lives, Segale died last year at 84. And it seems he may have been the last thing standing in the way of dark times at Nintendo. Mere months after Mario’s death, an ominous figure has come to power in Seattle. Yesterday, Nintendo of America’s beloved boss, Reggie Fils-Aime, stepped down, to be replaced by a man named Bowser. As in Bowser, AKA King Koopa, Mario’s nemesis: the fire-breathing dragon lizard thing constantly kidnapping Princess Peach (nee Toadstool; her English name has fluctuated over the years). He joins a slew of aptly named executives in the corporate world, including Zoe Hamburger, a marketing director at McDonald’s, and the energy and sustainability manager at Tata Steel, Barry Rust. Laugh all you want, but to Nintendo fans, this is no joke. They quickly pointed out a disturbing photo on Twitter. The new president, Doug Bowser, had introduced himself to the world with a photo apparently taken in his office – in front of stuffed Mario and Luigi dolls who had been tied up like hostages. It’s like if someone named Dave Vader took over Lucasfilm while waving Luke Skywalker’s severed hand, or if Disney’s next CEO were named Ursula “the Scar” Jafar and tweeted a picture of Simba being trampled by wildebeests. But is it coincidence, or conspiracy? Before Bowser joined Nintendo, he was at the rival Electronic Arts, so he has every reason to want to take Nintendo down. Indeed, in the press release announcing his hiring, methinks he doth protest too much about not being evil. It specifically states that he is “no relation to the King Koopa and Mario’s longtime nemesis” and tries to comfort gamers by saying he “brings decades of experience, not fire breath, to new role”. It also claims he will play “a key role in driving national sales strategies to generate demand and achieve revenue objectives across all of Nintendo’s product lines”, which sounds exactly like something King Koopa would do. With Mario’s passing last year, what can be done to save Nintendo? After decades of playing Super Mario games, I have a few suggestions: first, threatened staffers should try either jumping over or running under the new president. Behind him there should be a button that causes the bridge to disappear and he’ll fall into lava and re-emerge as a comical skeleton. Alternatively, they can try grabbing his tail and spinning him around and around until he goes flying into a spiky bomb. If none of these options work, it’s time to find the real Luigi.
The details of the first Fortnite World Cup have been announced by developer Epic Games. After 10 online qualifiers, the finals will be held in New York from 26-28 July, where the top 100 solo players and the top 50 two-person teams from around the world will compete for a prize pool of more than $30m (£23m). The top solo player at the end of a weekend of battle will earn $3m. Running from 8 April to June 16, the online qualifying rounds will be open to all eligible Fortnite players, each round offering $1m in prize money for high-performing entrants. Epic Games will also be continuing its in-game weekly $1m tournaments. No further details about the New York finals have been released, but the staging is likely to be spectacular. Last June, the developer held a pro/celebrity Fortnite tournament during the E3 video game conference in Los Angeles, hiring out the giant Banc of California Stadium and inviting 15,000 fans. Since its release in September 2017, Fortnite: Battle Royale has become one of the biggest video games in the world with over 200 million registered players. On 2 February, the game had its largest concurrent online player count when 10.7 million people logged in to view a virtual concert by dance music artist Marshmello. This will be Fortnite’s first major esports event, and it will be competing against games such as League of Legends and StarCraft 2, which attract vast online audiences as well as filling stadiums. Last year the League of Legends World Championship final, held at the Munhak Stadium in Incheon, South Korea, drew a peak online audience of over 100m.
The maker of Fortnite has pulled adverts from YouTube amid concerns that promotions for the video game, which is popular with children, were appearing alongside comments posted by paedophiles. Epic Games confirmed it had withdrawn its adverts from the Google-owned site, joining Nestlé in temporarily abandoning it due to the latest scandal over inappropriate content. A YouTube user called Matt Watson had posted a video highlighting a “wormhole into a softcore paedophile ring” on the site. He showed how in a matter of clicks with a new YouTube account, users could find videos filled with provocative comments about children. “Paedophiles are trading social media contacts; they’re trading links to actual child porn in YouTube comments; they’re trading unlisted videos in secret, and YouTube’s algorithm through some glitch in its programming is facilitating their ability to do this,” he said in the video. The scandal poses a challenge for YouTube because the videos themselves are not necessarily problematic. They are mostly innocent videos of young girls playing, doing exercises in their family home, or taking part in gymnastics. The issue is in the comments section, where YouTube users have left sexually provocative messages and shared tips on when to pause the videos to take compromising still images of the children. After watching a few such videos on a new YouTube account, Watson described how the site’s algorithm – designed to provide users with content they might like, to keep them watching – would serve up endless videos of apparently underage children where the comments section contained inappropriate comments. Many of these videos were also accompanied by adverts placed by major brands such as Nestlé, Fortnite and Disney. In a sign of the complicated media ecosystem that now exists on YouTube, where individual video creators can earn a share of the site’s advertising revenue, the reaction to the story from the wider YouTube community has not been entirely positive. Many other prominent YouTubers have accused Watson of overreacting. Some have criticised him for going public with his claims that paedophiles were using the site’s comments section. These YouTubers accuse Watson of trying to drive away advertisers from the site, depriving them of their often substantial incomes and attempting to cause an “adpocalypse”. This is a reference to previous occasions when large advertisers pulled money from the site over concerns about YouTube’s ability to ensure their adverts did not appear alongside disturbing or inappropriate content, such as videos published by terrorist organisations or hate preachers. A YouTube spokesman said of the latest claims: “Any content – including comments – that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube. “We took immediate action by deleting accounts and channels, reporting illegal activity to authorities and disabling comments on tens of millions of videos that include minors. There’s more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly.”
Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is almost unique in video game history. It suffered a deeply troubled development involving turbulent clashes between developer Troika and publisher Activision, and was eventually released incomplete and deeply broken. And yet, the 2004 financial disaster of a game is adored and celebrated for its innovative dialogue, astounding characters and banquet of choice. Kept alive ever since by a dedicated group of fans who have patched it up and improved it multiple times, it’s a game now remembered for its huge ambition rather than its colossal failure. Fifteen years later, a sequel has just been announced. Created by Hardsuit Labs (Blacklight: Retribution), along with Bloodlines’ original writer Brian Mitsoda, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has secretly been in development for three years. It will be released in 2020. Despite the secrecy, this is something that people had been hoping for since publisher Paradox announced it had acquired the rights in in 2015 – among them Martin Ka’ai Cluney, the creative director at Hardsuit. “It was late 2015, I read an article that Paradox had acquired World Of Darkness [the board game on which Bloodlines is based], and I immediately ran into our owners’ office and said, we’ve got to pitch for this,” he said, speaking at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco. Ka’ai Cluney and Brian Mitsoda had been friends for ten years, and the writer was immediately on board. After texting back and forth ideas, the two sat down in Mitsoda’s house, with a bottle of whisky between them, and worked out the major beats of the game’s plot, themes and characters in a single day. That week they sent over a plan to Paradox. Bloodlines gained its reputation, against significant odds, based on the strength of its characters and the phenomenal choice given to players – so much so that it almost didn’t matter that the game didn’t really work properly. This immediately puts a lot of expectation on the sequel. “It was hugely daunting,” continues Ka’ai Cluney. “But it was the goal from day one to establish those same principles.” For Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, the setting moves from Los Angeles to present-day Seattle, where a complex reimagining of the city’s history sees its multilayered past (metaphorically and physically) interwoven with vampire mythology and rivalry. Most interesting was the promise of a large selection of incidental stories, discoverable only by paying attention to the afterlives of those around you. These will let players investigate smaller mysteries, help out struggling fellow vampires, and work to protect the masquerade, the law of secrecy that keeps the public fooled about the existence of vampires. An early demo shown at GDC featured your character’s siring as a “Thin-blood”, a new vampire whose previous life impacts upon his post-death life. This, we’re told, means that players’ choices in creating their character will have an immediate impact on the experience. The game intends to “force you out of your humanity”, says Ka’ai Cluney. “If you can’t see people as cattle, you won’t get on well.” This quick glimpse reveals an adult, dark and potentially deep world in which to play. Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will be coming to PC and consoles early next year.
There is a moment in parenthood when your child discovers you are not infallible, that you can be beaten. The first time a kid wins a game of tennis against their mum or dad, or solves a maths problem their parents can’t even begin to understand, it is profoundly bittersweet. While it is wonderful to see your child growing up and becoming independent, when they get good at things, they are a little bit less yours, and you are a little bit less heroic. It is sometimes hard to be the grownup in that situation and not deal with it childishly. I discovered this on Saturday when my eldest son and I were playing Apex Legends. My wife had taken our younger son to Jersey for the weekend to see her sister, and I thought it would be a treat to hunker down with our first born and spend a few hours fighting against strangers together in the battle royale shooter game of the moment. Players are automatically put into online groups of three, so we set up two TVs and two consoles so we could compete together in the same squad. My son and I have not played together much since the days of our epic Minecraft sessions or when we’d spend hours battling through every one of the Lego action adventures, dividing up the puzzles between us. That was when he was eight or nine. He’s 13 now, and plays with with friends he meets online. I hear them from the other room, sharing jokes and trash-talking through their headsets. My son is better than me at Apex Legends, a game that demands excellent hand-eye coordination and accuracy. Every encounter is super-fast and deadly. I know what I need to do – I grew up playing Doom and Quake Arena, so I know how to approach enemies – and I know the right techniques, but my reactions just aren’t fast enough. One game in and my son is already trying to explain how to play. “I know,” I tell him, “I’ve been playing these games since before you were born!” But while I’m expounding on the history and lineage of the first-person shooter game, I’ve been downed again. By the third match, he’s getting restless. He is not giving me instructions any more, and when we start the game and fly on to the map, he’s separating from me while still in mid-air. I’m a liability. It is strange, that realisation that your children are utterly distinct from you. I got a similar feeling when my sons first went into town without us, and my wife and I spotted them later on from the car, just strolling along, living a part of their lives away from us. I often cringe inwardly when I hear my sons talk about games with their friends; the way they glorify their own actions and dismiss others as “noobs”, “try-hards” or “hackers”. But what annoys me isn’t their inflated bravado and confidence in their own abilities, it’s that these conversations are happening without me. Their heroes are the YouTubers and Twitch streamers who discover glitches in games, or unlock the best gear first, or figure out what the big reveal will be in the next Fortnite season. As a games writer, It’s my job to know at least some of this. Who knows how other mums and dads cope. I thought about trying to get my son to play Portal 2 with me instead of Apex Legends. This classic sci-fi puzzle game relies on mental dexterity and advanced planning skills – the stuff I’m still better at than he is. But that is sort of pathetic. On Sundays when I was a kid, my dad and I would to take a football to the park to play penalties. He’d put the ball down on the spot and shoot, and I’d have to try to save one, and then I’d get a go as striker. One time, I saved every shot he played. I knew at the end he was really trying to score, but the goals in the park were quite small, and I was a tall kid. I stopped them all. On the way home, Dad was quiet, and without really understanding why, I found myself regretting not letting that last shot go in. I wonder if my son was thinking that when he fired me from his Apex Legends squad. If he was, he certainly kept it to himself. “Can I play with my friends again now?” he asked sheepishly. I said yes, and left them to it. Barely seconds later, I could hear them all laughing together as though nothing momentous had happened.
Google’s announcement of game-streaming service Stadia may not have been a huge industry revelation; Google has made no secret of its ambitions to enter the video game market, and it was somewhat given away by public trials last September. Instead, it was the things that weren’t revealed at Tuesday’s Game Developers Conference keynote that took many by surprise. Ahead of the event, a long list of big-name reveals had been rumoured – but none materialised, except Bethesda’s Doom: Eternal, which was not shown actually running on Stadia. And of course everyone was on tenterhooks to find out how much it was all going to cost, information that was also absent. “There’s just so much that I didn’t learn today that I really wanted to,” says Gizmodo’s Alex Cranz. “And that makes me nervous about it.” Video-game streaming services are certainly nothing new. OnLive launched a cloud-based game subscription business in 2010, but had ceased operations by 2015. It is one of at least 10 other companies that have tried and failed. The survivors are Nvidia’s GeForce NOW, Shadow and Loudplay, and of course Sony’s own Playstation Now. But Google believes it is bringing something new to this market, based on the sheer scale of its infrastructure, and the technology it is putting at the other end of the cable. “The specs were really impressive,” adds Cranz. “Those were on par with a 2080 [GPU] from Nvidia and a really nice Intel processor, so [equivalent to] a really good gaming PC. But it’s a completely new platform that people will have to develop games for, so I don’t know how easy it’s going to be to translate games that are already developed for console or PC. This [keynote] felt like less like something for the general public, and more like a pitch to the developers.” “I’ve always been super-sceptical about streaming games,” says Ragnar Tørnquist, founder of Red Thread Games and veteran developer. “I was told 10 years ago it was going to be everything, and I said no, that’s impossible. But I do think this is the beginning of a sea-change.” Chet Faliszek, Valve alumnus and co-founder of new development studio Stray Bombay, agrees the time seems to be right for gaming to move toward streaming. “Digital downloads brought us closer,” he tells us. “Stadia seems like the natural progression in our always-connected world.” The point of game streaming, in theory, is to liberate games and players from consoles and PCs: to enable them to play on any screen, without having to purchase a £350 box to sit under the TV. There is general agreement in the games industry that this would open games up to millions (even billions) more people. “Removing friction between gamers and the game is always the goal,” says Faliszek, enthused to see what the tools will be able to deliver. Tørnquist agrees: “I think that removing technology as a barrier is interesting. It’s interesting for creators as well, as we can get people into our games who don’t have the hardware for it.” The question is whether most people in the world have access to a fast enough internet connection to make it work. What sort of internet connection would be required to achieve Google’s ambitious 4K streaming? Cranz estimates it would need to be fairly sizeable. “Right now that requires 40-50Mbps, which most Americans do not have. More than half the United States won’t be able to play any of this.” “But half of people do have internet good enough,” points out Tørnquist –his argument being, for Stadia to succeed, it doesn’t need to include everyone, just enough people. Competition is always welcome too, for developers as well as players: the more ways there are to reach customers, the less of a stranglehold over the market each competitor has. “I think [streaming] is going to eat into the PC and console market, which is a good thing,” says Tørnquist. Oxenfree developer Night School Studio’s Sean Krankel agrees. “I think more competition is good. I like the idea of things being shaken up.” Krankel is also rather taken with some of the new possibilities that Stadia opens up, including what Google is calling State Share, a feature that will allow players to share an exact moment in a game with others. He is also enthusiastic about the instant YouTube sharing built into Stadia. “For people who grew up with it, this is just a part of gaming. Video streaming culture has become vital for studios, as opposed to a thing to be afraid of.” There is also less nervousness from developers around the idea of subscription services, as Stadia is likely to be. Microsoft’s Game Pass has led the way on this, offering a catalogue of games for a monthly price. “Game Pass has been extraordinary for us, because it lets people who would not otherwise play our games try our stuff,” says Krankel. “We’ve seen a lift – when we put [Oxenfree] on Game Pass, sales did better elsewhere. It was crazy!” It is bizarre that any kind of pricing model was totally absent from Google’s announcement. The audience was shown a huge array of ways players could see a trailer, or glance at a tweet, and be just a single click away from streaming the game on whatever device they were using. But not how much it will cost. “Is this is going to be something I subscribe to monthly? Is it something where I own the game? Am I going to have to reinvest in games I already own?” asks Alex Cranz. “There were just so many questions there, and no answers.” This raises questions about the idea of ownership. Though perhaps, as in the music and TV industries with Spotify and Netflix, the idea of ownership is becoming less important to players. “The Netflixisation of the industry is going to happen,” says Tørnquist with certainty. “Which is good for us in the short term, but in the long term, maybe not. If you lose your games on Stadia, do you lose what you purchased there? Do you lose your saves? [With streaming] you lose the permanence of it. No copy of that game exists anywhere you can access. You’d have to physically break into their data centre to steal it! Games are going to appear and disappear as the industry moves further into the cloud. People will just carry on with their lives – but what we’ve made could go away forever.” A potentially sticky fact about Google is that the company does have a habit of losing interest in its less successful projects. Emails are being sent out this week warning people to back up any data they may have in Google Plus, before it’s entirely closed down next month. Its 2016 answer to Facebook’s Messenger, Google Allo, was switched off just last week. And anyone who moved on from the ageing Gmail to the much superior Inbox is having to move back again when that’s shut down in a week. People may well wonder if they should trust Google with their games as much as they would trust established gaming names like Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony. Everyone we spoke to at the Game Developers Conference was interested in what Stadia could be, although most were hedging their bets until a lot of the questions are answered. How easy will it be for developers to adapt existing games for Stadia? How will pricing work? Which games will be playable on release later this year? What kind of internet connection will be required to use it? And what happens down the line if Google’s attention drifts on to something else? Yesterday’s presentation offered up more questions than answers about Stadia. It’ll be summer before the picture becomes clearer.
Google announced its entry into the video game market with Google Stadia, a service that will allow players to stream video games to any screen – phone, tablet, TV or computer. Google announced Stadia at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco on Tuesday. The cloud-powered service will allow users to log in from any screen using the Chrome browser, a Chromecast device or a Google Pixel phone or tablet and play the same games across all of them, with all the computational heavy-lifting done by Google’s servers instead of a games console. It means that players won’t have to purchase a box that sits under the TV in order to play, theoretically liberating video games from hardware altogether. Google did not announce pricing, but it is likely that the service will be subscription-based. The service is expected to launch later in 2019 in the US, Canada, the UK and “most of Europe”. Stadia will also be fully integrated with YouTube, where gaming content is among the most popular on the site, watched by hundreds of millions of people every day. Google demonstrated a button that will let users watching video game footage on YouTube instantly click to play the game themselves. Stadia will also allow for easy capturing and sharing of game clips. Google will launch its own controller for use with the service, though existing USB controllers will also work. Google’s gamepad is fairly conventional in design, with two sticks, triggers, face buttons, and function buttons that allow instant clip-sharing and Google Assistant activation. Previous game streaming offerings such as 2010’s OnLive have failed because of latency problems and “lag” – it doesn’t matter much if a TV show or film streams on a slight delay, but video games demand instant responsiveness when you press a button, and even a small delay can make them unpleasant to play. Google’s immense server infrastructure will mitigate that, the company says, allowing for smooth gaming at the standard that players expect from a console, in 4k resolution and at 60 frames a second. Google has plenty of video game industry veterans on board to launch Stadia. Phil Harrison, formerly of Sony PlayStation, is the vice-president and GM of Google, and the VP of gaming, Jade Raymond, is a former producer at Ubisoft, where she led the Assassin’s Creed series for years. Bethesda’s forthcoming shooter Doom Eternal was demonstrated on stage as a flagship game, but no others have yet been announced. Google has, however, created its own video game development studio that will deliver exclusive games as well as other publishers’ titles.
Over a year since it was announced in November 2017, Warner Bros has lifted the lid on Harry Potter: Wizards Unite, a hotly anticipated new augmented reality game for smartphones due out later this year. Developed by Pokémon Go creator Niantic in collaboration with Warner’s Portkey Games label, Wizards Unite overlays the wizarding world on the real world, asking players to walk around their neighbourhoods with their phones to uncover traces of magic. It draws both from the Harry Potter films and books, and the Fantastic Beasts additions. Cast as an enforcer for the Statute of Secrecy Task Force – the organisation that keeps the magical world secret from us Muggles – players will find magical creatures, artefacts and characters, tracing spells on the phone’s screen to return them to their proper place. Some real-world locations will be transformed into Inns in the game, and it will also feature Portkeys that transport players to iconic places from the Potterverse, such as Ollivander’s wand shop in Diagon Alley. Users will also be to team up for duels, using spells and potions to track down and defeat Dementors and Death Eaters. Niantic’s previous game, Pokémon Go, became a global phenomenon when it was released in 2016, peaking at 300 million players. It still has about 60 million active players, and has been continually updated over the years with new Pokémon and features. The developer – and Warner – will be hoping for similar success with Wizards Unite, which is based on another childhood favourite of the millennial generation. Harry Potter: Wizards Unite will be released later this year. Pre-registration for Android players is available through Google Play.
A father and daughter are driving through a remote area of America when a ghostly figure steps into the road, forcing the car to swerve wildly. As the man regains consciousness, he realises the car is a wreck and his daughter is missing. Shocked and confused, he staggers into the nearby town of Silent Hill, where his nightmare truly begins. Loaded with dread, this scene could be the opening of a nasty horror movie. In fact, it’s the setup to the classic video game Silent Hill, launched on this day 20 years ago by the Japanese gaming company Konami. Alongside Capcom’s Resident Evil, the title helped popularise the survival horror genre of action thrillers, which are characterised by tense exploration, expressionistic camera angles, fiendish environmental puzzles and limited access to weaponry, making every encounter with a monster a mortal challenge. But the differences between Silent Hill and Resident Evil are profound. The latter presents a conventional heroic narrative, with the player-characters unambiguously coded as righteous saviours who must eradicate the evil represented by the zombies to restore symbolic order. In Silent Hill, originally billed as psychological horror, the roles are muddier. Lead character Harry Mason is a normal guy, frightened and disoriented by the accident: he gets breathless after running short distances, and the weapon-aiming mechanic is awkward and inaccurate, to symbolise his inexperience. This is a game that deliberately disempowers its protagonist and, through him, the player. Silent Hill is inspired by much more avant garde source material than Resident Evil. While the latter is beholden to horror maestros such as George A Romero and Lucio Fulci, Konami’s Team Silent development studio, including first-time director Keiichirō Toyama, was influenced by David Lynch and Dario Argento. Silent Hill is like Twin Peaks, a town of sullen diners, abandoned amusement parks and sinister gothic lodges. As in Argento’s movies, the game’s world is filled with occultist icons and powerful demons waiting to be summoned. Meanwhile, artist Takayoshi Sato drew from the work of Francis Bacon, whose bizarre and disturbing portraits of people in states of metamorphosis clearly inspired the game’s menagerie of amorphous monsters. Silent Hill is about internal conflict and psychological breakdown. As Harry explores the abandoned town, looking for clues, meeting its weird, damaged inhabitants (another Lynchian device), we’re encouraged to doubt the veracity of what he is experiencing. Blackouts and nightmare sequences suggest Harry is hallucinating, other characters continually question reality and the plot wildly contradicts itself. In the apocalyptic world of Silent Hill, school corridors are coated in blood, hospital wards are filled with rusted beds, the sheets disgustingly stained. But is this environmental degradation real, or is it symbolic of Harry’s mental deterioration? Outside, in the streets there is an omnipresent fog obscuring everything more than a few feet away. This was a common technical feature of PlayStation games of the time, reducing the amount of rendering the rudimentary graphics hardware had to deal with, but it was never employed to such eerie and dislocating effect as it was here. The opening sequence, in which Harry chases a vision of his daughter through the streets – her presence often little more than a ghostly white figure in the mist – is a masterful example of using technical limitations for atmospheric effect. Sound, too, is deftly employed to induce terror. Audio director Akira Yamaoka used and manipulated sounds from everyday life – construction site equipment, idling engines, dripping taps, bells and clocks – to create a sense of twisted familiarity. In the game, Harry famously discovers a portable radio that emits static whenever a monster is near. It’s incredibly effective because the sound is loaded with horror fiction connotations: like the static from the TV screen in Poltergeist that alerts us to the ghosts; or the static in apocalyptic movies that tells us no one is transmitting, and society has collapsed. What Harry uncovers in this broken town is a centuries-old cult, determined to resurrect an ancient demon of immense evil and power. There are four endings to uncover (five if you include the comedy alternative), each with its own slant on the game’s true meaning. But the game is so rich in Freudian symbolism – from slitheringly phallic monsters to the witch-like lead antagonist Dahlia Gillespie, who has obvious connotations of the archaic mother – that a purely psychosexual reading is very possible (an element carried through to each subsequent Silent Hill title). Silent Hill might be a horror game about a small town that gets swallowed up by a cultist evil. Or it might be about mental health and anxiety. Or, in the way the narrative begins to confuse and combine Harry’s young child, Cheryl, with a teenaged character named Alessa, it might also be about a parent who fears losing their beloved daughter to adolescence. This fear of burgeoning adulthood and sexuality also underpins Carrie, The Exorcist and countless other horror flicks loaded with dread about female bodies. This is the lasting brilliance of Silent Hill and the fascinating series it birthed. The game’s development team set out to make a horror game that offered more than jump scares – something shocking, unusual and transgressive. They learned that blurring ambiguity and familiarity, psychology and sexuality, naturalism and symbolism was a way to achieve this on a modest budget and with limited technical means. Every tense, dark, weird horror game that followed – from Dead Space and FEAR to Soma – owes a debt to the craft of Silent Hill. It told the player that true horror is rarely out there in the fog, in the abandoned hospital, or even in the overgrown cemetery. It has been inside us the entire time.
I’m sorry to have to tell you this – not everybody takes it well – but you’re probably not as good as you think you are at Tetris. It’s tough to take. Until this morning I thought I was a Tetris prodigy. Beginning with a year-long asynchronous rivalry with my brother on the Game Boy, where each of us would play obsessively until we’d topped all the high-score tables before smugly handing the console over to the other, I’ve played Tetris most of my life. I finished last year’s Tetris Effect, a version of the Russian block-rotating puzzle game that somehow turns it into a psychedelic meditation on the birth of the universe, in one three-hour session. But last night, in a surprise announcement, Nintendo released Tetris 99 – a battle royale version of Tetris for the Nintendo Switch. (If you’ve got a Nintendo online pass, you can play it right now, for free.) This is Tetris meets Fortnite, with 99 players starting each game and just one victor. I downloaded it this morning and match after match, I languished in the bottom 50, assailed continually by grey blocks. It came close to prompting an identity crisis. Am I secretly this rubbish at everything? I even started concocting conspiracy theories: maybe I’m failing this much because I’m good at Tetris! It’s clearly giving me an invisible handicap. Tetris is surely the most unlikely game yet to jump on the Battle Royale bandwagon. The trend was first popularised by PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, and made stratospherically popular by the now-ubiquitous Fortnite. In the past year, shooting-game standbys Call of Duty and Battlefield V both announced and introduced Battle Royale modes, and earlier this month EA released Apex Legends, a brand-new shooter that’s already challenging Fortnite’s viewership on game-streaming platforms such as Twitch. But battle royale Tetris? How does that work? As in two-player competitive Tetris, players in Tetris 99 can target each other with attacks. Clearing lines sends them off to threaten someone else’s screen; go too long without making any Tetrises of your own, and lines of grey blocks suddenly appear at the bottom of your screen, igniting panic. The music is a heart-rate-raising techno remix of the classic Tetris theme, which speeds up as players are eliminated. This isn’t just 99 players playing individual games at the same time. It’s brutal. Forget serene, calming Tetris, where blocks fall slowly and you arrange them into pleasing configurations to make them disappear. Oh no. This is survival Tetris, where you’re squeezing tetrominos into teensy gaps at high speed as the screen fills, desperate for just a single line, like an investment banker stuck in his hometown on a Saturday night. Tetris 99 has already taught me new things about Tetris. After several dismal finishes, I went online to see if there was something I was missing and discovered a new realm of pro Tetris moves. Have you heard of a T-spin? I’ve now watched two tutorials on them, and my head hurts. However, trying to set one up was so distracting that I started seeing that screenful of failure-blocks even quicker. So I reverted to speed: instead of patiently lining up four-line combos, I kept my long blocks in reserve and focused on just clearing lines as quickly as possible. There’s always a small element of chance – if five players all start ganging up on you at once, you’ve little hope – but it has definitely helped to play aggressively. It’s been a couple of hours and I’m not as crap at Tetris 99 as I was. I just scored a lucky third-place finish, which may well be a career best, because the blocks were falling at such speed that I ceased to be capable of conscious thought. I’m also pathetically unable to stop playing it – twice, while writing these words, I had to stop and play another round. Like all battle royale games, your every sweet taste of almost-success makes you hungry for more. Tetris Battle Royale is a brilliant idea. Just be prepared to take the hit to your ego when you discover that you’re much worse at it than you thought.
On 6 December 2018, game developer Chris Hunt’s magnum opus was finally complete. Hunt had been working on Kenshi, in which players navigate a tribe of people through a strange, low-tech alien world, for more than 10 years. You might think finishing it would be a huge milestone in Hunt’s career. But if anything, the opposite is true. “No one was really bothered by the official release, because nothing will change,” says Hunt, who speaks in a laid-back, laconic fashion that makes him seem affable and yet strangely distant. “People kept saying, ‘Ah, don’t release it too soon.’ I think they were worried that I was going to leave it buggy or incomplete.” This bizarre situation has emerged because, despite being a decade in the making, Kenshi has been playable for half that time, and already has thousands of fans. Kenshi belongs to a sub-group of “Early Access” games on the biggest online PC games storefront, Steam. Through the platform, developers can release their games in an unfinished state, and use the revenue raised from purchases to fund the remainder of development. It can be likened to crowdfunding, although rather than investing on a promise, purchasers of the games can play along as development progresses. Kenshi was one of 12 games selected to launch the initiative in March 2013. Of those, nine have been finished, two have ceased development, and one is stuck in limbo. Alongside Kenshi, the released games are Kerbal Space Program, ARMA 3, Prison Architect, Drunken Robot Pornography, Gnomoria , Gear Up, Starforge and Kinetic Void. Steam Early Access facilitates projects that would be otherwise impossible to produce. But it raises questions about the relationship between developers and customers, and the responsibilities of Steam’s owner, Valve Corporation, to monitor what’s going on. Although Kenshi was one of the first Early Access games, its story begins much earlier. So long ago, in fact, that Hunt cannot remember exactly when he began working on it. “I’ve been designing games since I was a kid,” he says. “I’d play a bunch, get inspired and start designing on paper. [Kenshi] came from a lifetime of playing games.” Kenshi is a role-playing-game, although it interprets that idea more literally than most. Players don’t become some fantasy hero destined for glory, the familiar Dungeons and Dragons triptych of warrior, mage or rogue. Instead, they can be anything they like within Kenshi’s vast and strange world: a trader, a farmer, a bandit, a thief. It’s a game about forging your own path in a world indifferent to your success or failure. Opportunities are many, but risks are also high, and a character’s story can come to a swift end courtesy of vicious wildlife or roaming groups of bandits. Hunt had put five years into Kenshi before Steam launched its Early Access section, much of that time as a full-time solo developer. He had even started selling prototype copies, using services such as Desura and his own website. When Valve began searching for games to feature, Kenshi was ahead of the pack. “Kenshi looks really good on a store-page, because it’s just a huge list of dreamlike features,” says Hunt. “It had a fanbase, and it was pretty far along in development.” Steam has been vital in supporting Kenshi’s development, being responsible for 95% of all its sales. At the same time, the sheer exposure of being on Steam is also responsible for 95% of Hunt’s stress and worry. “You have to really be ready to release in Early Access, because people will come down on you like a hammer,” he says. “You get a wave of people judging you instantly. Every single bug is a panic.” When customers are paying for an unfinished product, expectations are high. Hunt believes one of the reasons Kenshi has maintained its development for so long is through constant communication and regular updates. “If we did an update every four months, then everyone would get angry and during that gap would be saying, ‘The game’s abandoned!’” he says. “But if we did the same amount of work, but broke it up into an update every day, people felt it was really well maintained.’” But supporting an unfinished game’s development with its sales over several years is not easy. “There was one point in development where I handed everyone their notices,” Hunt says. “We were completely running out of money.” Hunt planned to continue working on the game alone, reducing its overall scope. Then sales suddenly picked up, and it was back to business as usual. Not every project has been so fortunate. Another game from the initial batch was Under the Ocean, a subaquatic survival game developed by New Zealand-based artist Paul Hart and programmer Mike Reitzenstein. Boasting a unique art style and a setting that distinguished it from other survival games at the time, Under the Ocean was one of Steam’s most interesting prospects. But the project ran into trouble about a year into development. “With previous games, Mike and I had a very focused vision, with little outside influence,” says Hart. “But with Early Access we modified our vision to fit feedback.” One of these modifications was to make each update to the game themed around a specific idea or feature, in the hopes of attracting an influx of new buyers. But the pair found the process disruptive, and in early 2015, Reitzenstein decided to leave the project. This left Hart without a programmer, and thereby without any realistic chance of finishing the game. Not long after, he made the decision to delist Under the Ocean from Steam. “A big part of why I hesitated cancelling the project earlier is the disappointment of letting the player-base down,” Hart says. This is the risk developers take with Early Access. An unfinished project is always disappointing for its creator. But when thousands of other people play a role in funding that project, the disappointment is magnified many times over, and with it comes a burden of neglected responsibility. Hart continued working on the game for the next three years, at weekends, but finally decided to cancel the project a couple of months ago. Throughout, Hart has tried to maintain goodwill with the game’s remaining fanbase, offering free copies of his other games to owners of Under the Ocean – and, more unusually, promising free copies of games he plans to make in the future. Under the Ocean may have failed, but Hart has done all he can to make the best of an unfortunate situation. The same cannot be said of every Early Access title. Patterns, a game by Second Life developer Linden Labs, unceremoniously ceased development in 2014, sparking much ire. But this is nothing compared to the confounding case of the bizarrely named 1…2…3…KICK IT! (Drop That Beat like an Ugly Baby). Kick It is a Guitar Hero-style music game developed by Boston-based outfit Dejobaan Games. It launched on Early Access in March 2013 alongside Kenshi, Under the Ocean and Patterns. Nearly six years later, the game remains available to purchase for £6.99 – but no progress has been made on its development. Dejobaan was contacted several times for comment, asking about the game’s current state and whether there were any plans for further release. There was no response. The last official update occurred in August 2014. Dejobaan’s founder, Ichiro Lambe, apologised for the delays in production, stating that the game’s code had “not been in a playable state”, and assuring owners that he was going to “keep on working on the game” until he was happy with it. Dejobaan has officially remained silent since that announcement, but one of its developers released new footage of the game in January 2017. Nonetheless, most of Kick It’s customer base is doubtful the game will ever be finished, convinced that it has been abandoned. Games like Kick It also raise questions about the potential for Early Access games to take advantage of their customer base. Should a developer be allowed to continue selling an unfinished game that hasn’t been updated in over five years? Hunt is disparaging. “I think it’s damaging to everyone in the long term,” he says. “At the very least, if a game hasn’t been updated enough, they could put a stamp on it that says ‘Possibly abandoned’”. Valve, for its part, places the onus of responsibility with the customer. The Steam page for every Early Access game features a boilerplate disclaimer that states: “This Early Access game is not complete and may or may not change further.” Meanwhile, on its About page for Early Access, Valve implores users not to buy a game unless they are happy to play it in its existing state. Such sweeping statements are indicative of Valve’s apparent approach to managing Steam. Valve employs a “desks-on-wheels” culture that encourages staff to work on whatever project they like. Rather than appoint staff of its own to watch over the storefront, Valve encourages users to leave reviews and create “curator” lists to highlight their favourites. Earlier this year, after multiple attempts at creating various automated gatekeeping systems, Valve’s Erik Johnson announced the decision to allow any developer to list games on the store with the vague exception of “things that we decide are illegal, or straight-up trolling”. At a time when big-tech companies are being increasingly scrutinised for their social responsibilities, Valve’s hands-off approach to managing Steam is not a good look. It’s hard to know precisely what percentage of Early Access projects have been successful, how many have failed, and how many linger on like Kick It. But even if only a small percentage of the fruit in a greengrocers is rotten, it shouldn’t be the customer’s responsibility to avoid it. It should be off the shelves. With Kenshi, there’s no question that Early Access has been of great benefit to the game. If Kick It! remains in limbo, Kenshi will be the last of the original 12 games to see a proper launch. For Hunt, it’s a curiously melancholy moment. “To me it means I can start a new game, finally. I’ll still continue fixing stuff, the important stuff, but it’s the point where I can find time for another project,” he says. “It’s kind of like the end.”
